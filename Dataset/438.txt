The painting is titeld "The Deposition" by Arnold Böcklin from 1871-74.
Böcklin's flair for archaization, one already employed by the Nazarenes, is seen in the Quattrocento colouring of this Deposition. Part camp theatricality, part convinced and convincing Christianity, part prophecy, this canvas proved to be an Avant-Garde and unpopular work when first exhibited at the Vienna Exposition.
