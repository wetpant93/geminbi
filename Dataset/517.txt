The painting is titeld "Ramón Casas and Pere Romeu on a Tandem" by Ramón Casas I Carbó from 1897.
The stark contrasts of black and white, and the emphasis on lines give the painting a strongly graphic quality. It is hardly surprising to learn that Casas was close to Toulouse-Lautrec and also did posters and graphic work. In fact he did some two hundred charcoal portraits of famous contemporaries.
