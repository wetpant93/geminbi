The painting is titeld "Ville-d'Avray" by Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot from 1860s.
Throughout his adult life, Corot spent part of each year at the family property in Ville-d'Avray in the environs of Paris. The landscapes painted there in the 1860s and 1870s - views of wooded glades delicately modeled in dull greens, browns, and an exquisite range of silvery grays, all veiled in misty light - won him considerable success during his lifetime.
