The painting is titeld "Cloud Study with Horizon" by Johan Christian Clausen Dahl from 1832.
After working as a decorative painter in his home town of Bergen, Norway, Dahl studied landscape painting at the Copenhagen Academy from 1811 to 1818. Here he was impressed by the work of Jens Juel and Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg, but the crucial influence came with a study of the seventeenth-century Dutch masters of landscape. One of them, Allaert Everdingen, had visited Norway and subsequently developed a type of "Nordic landscape" based on his impressions. This style was later taken up by the Norwegian national movement in the nineteenth century. Alongside the "Italian landscape," the "Nordic landscape" also became established on the Continent early in the century.
