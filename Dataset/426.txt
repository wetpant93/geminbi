The painting is titeld "In a Roman Osteria" by Carl Heinrich Bloch from 1866.
This painting is an intensified version of a painting by one of Bloch's major predecessors, Wilhelm Marstrand (1810-1873); specifically his charming Italian Osteria Scene from 1848 (Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek). It is one of Bloch's most popular genre pictures and is typical of his seductive ability to depict objects, details, and clothes with striking realism.
