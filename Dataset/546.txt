The painting is titeld "Mardi Gras" by Paul Cézanne from 1888.
Cézanne ensured that his painting suggest space without destroying the unity of the surface by making use of the knowledge that cold colours, such as blue and green, appear to recede, and warm colours - red, orange, yellow - seem to stand out from the surface.
