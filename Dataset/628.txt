The painting is titeld "Self-Portrait (Man with Pipe)" by Gustave Courbet from 1848-49.
Among the paintings Courbet exhibited in the 1851 Salon was a self-portrait in which he seems to be judiciously eyeing the spectator. Man with Pipe represented the first important stage in his awareness of the direction that his artistic maturity would take. We note that this was the first self-portrait that Courbet parted with; he had kept all the others and even of this one made a copy that never left his studio.
