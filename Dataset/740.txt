The painting is titeld "Two Laundresses" by Edgar Degas from 1884.
Degas's paintings of the working class have a social content. He took up themes treated earlier by HonorÃ© Daumier and painted women ironing, washerwomen, milliners. In contrast to Daumier, Degas saw no heroism in everyday modern work.
