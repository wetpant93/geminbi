The painting is titeld "Breton Women in a Meadow" by Émile Bernard from 1888.
Having adopted a technique inspired by Neo-Impressionis, Émile Bernard then laid the foundations of Cloisonnism, a principle to which in the space of a few months he went on to give very varied versions, ranging from a geometrical simplification that anticipated Art Nouveau to a kind of medievalism with mystic overtones.
