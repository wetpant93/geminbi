The painting is titeld "Allegory on the Peace of Pressburg" by Andrea Appiani from 1808.
In Appiani, Napoleon commissioned the premier court painter of Italy within the country itself. The Lombardy master had become famous with a ceiling painting in the palace of Monza and was celebrated as the "pittor delle Grazie". The painter used a very much softer application of paint than his Italian contemporaries, as is evident in this painting.
