The painting is titeld "Ecce Homo" by Antonio Ciseri from 1891.
In the mid-nineteenth century, awareness of the Italian past extended to the study of the old Italian masters, and especially of the fourteenth- and fifteenth-century primitives. From 1848 to 1859, this interest was apparent in the Tuscan Purist, among them Antonio Ciseri.
