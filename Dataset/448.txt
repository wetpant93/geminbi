The painting is titeld "The Croquet Game" by Pierre Bonnard from 1892.
During the period 1890-92, Gauguin and Japan were the major influences on Bonnard's work, affecting both the imagery and decorative character of his work, from The Parade Ground (1890; private collection), a humorous souvenir of a military period, up to the great composition of the Croquet Game (1892; Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris), which depicts his family playing in the park at Grand-Lemps.
