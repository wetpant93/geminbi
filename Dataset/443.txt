The painting is titeld "Oxen Pulling a Cart" by Giovanni Boldini from 1885.
The majestic long-horned white oxen of Tuscany were an attractive subject even for an artist like Boldini, who usually preferred portraits to landscape paintings. Both the peasant at the left as well as the cart at the right are cut off from the picture plane, thus stressing the animals' presence as the main focus of attention. The bright red of the garlands and the cart are effectively set off against their white bodies.
