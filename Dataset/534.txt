The painting is titeld "Cherries and Peaches" by Paul CÃ©zanne from 1883-87.
The perspective of this picture is broken in a number of ways; the plate of cherries is shown from a different angle to the other objects. The picture emphasizes the fact that it is two-dimensional by refusing to use any form of illusion.
