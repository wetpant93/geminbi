The painting is titeld "Female Nude Reclining on a Divan" by Eug√®ne Delacroix from 1825-26.
There is a manifest sensuality to this dreaming woman with her body offered up to the spectator's gaze, and we know from the Journal that Delacroix's relations with his models often went beyond the pictorial; but there are also traces of the influence of Bonington in the presentation, and perhaps of Delacroix's desire to emulate Ingres' nudes.
