The painting is titeld "Lake Annecy" by Paul Cézanne from 1896.
Cézanne thought Lake Annecy, with its dramatic mountain surroundings, was almost too picturesque, suited "to drawing exercises for young Englishwomen." In his hands, the lake becomes an opaque area of colour, and the sides of the mountains are tectonic masses.
