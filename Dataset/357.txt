The painting is titeld "Knight before the Charcoal Burner's Hut" by Carl Philipp Fohr from 1816.
Only five oil paintings by this artist are known, but the mastery evident in his small output indicates the career he would surely have had. Dark, deeply glowing colours and a feeling for landscapes elevated to the romantic ideal show his supreme ability in this painting as well.
