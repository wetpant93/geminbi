The painting is titeld "Nirvana, Portrait of Meyer de Haan" by Paul Gauguin from c. 1890.
This picture was painted during Gauguin's stay in Le Pouldu, Brittany. Meyer de Haan (1852-1895) was a Dutch industrialist who sold his factory to his brothers and started to study painting. He settled in France. In Paris he met Pissarro, Theo van Gogh, and Paul Gauguin, whom De Haan accompanied to Brittany - first to Pont-Aven, and later to Le Pouldu, on the coast of Brittany.
