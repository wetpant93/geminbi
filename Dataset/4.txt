The painting is titeld "The Menorah" by Luigi Ademollo from 1816.
This scene is a detail of the fresco cycle in the Room of the Ark. This shows the preparation of a Jewish festivity that is about to take place under a tentlike structure. Baskets of bread and jars of wine are being set up for distribution to the crowds during the celebration. The display of the massive menorah, a golden candelabrum with seven arms, serves as the dominating symbol of the Jewish people.
