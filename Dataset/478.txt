The painting is titeld "Mill" by Sándor Brodszky from 1858.
This artist belonged to the generation that followed Markó's, and he and his fellow artists were some of the first to return home from Munich and fulfil the public's demand for landscapes. The enthusiasm for lithographs and engravings that had arisen in the thirties revived again in the fifties, and all the landscapes showing the Hungarian scenery are charged with renewed patriotism and love of nature. The atmosphere is therefore all the more gloomy, as the bitter memory of 1848 and the suppression that followed lent bitter sentiment to landscapes, too. In place of the heroic castles and gay vedutas, ruins, stormy forests and deserted little cottages appear in these pictures. The subject of Brodszky's rather dry, meticulous drawing is a dilapidated, abandoned mill.
