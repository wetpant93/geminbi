The painting is titeld "Still-Life" by Paul Cézanne from 1871.
Grouped objects (along with the splendours of Provençal landscape) provided Cézanne with his grandest, most successful affirmation of heroic vision, as pertinent to future Modernism as it was to the continued awareness of French Classicism. The austere still-life of 1871 is in many ways prophetic of Fauvism and Cubism as well as of the late Braque.
