The painting is titeld "Landscape" by Paul Cézanne from 1870-71.
Cézanne has used an unspectacular natural formation as his motif: a forest path on a rocky pine-covered hillside. However, the contrasting colours and interplay of light and shade make this simple subject very expressive, and its effect is due to the fact that Cézanne has painted reality as he sees it, without embellishment.
