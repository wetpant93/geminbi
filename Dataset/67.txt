The painting is titeld "Tivoli Gardens at the Villa d'Este" by Karl Blechen from 1831-32.
Corot was in Rome at the time of Blechen's Italian travels. Both painters working 'en plein air', and new freedom shaped their art. An inevitable view of the Tivoli Gardens at the Villa d'Este escapes the clich√©d aspects of that setting.
