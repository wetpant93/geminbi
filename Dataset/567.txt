The painting is titeld "The Bridge at Maincy" by Paul Cézanne from 1882-85.
The Bridge at Maincy, near Melun, surrounded by slender trees in glowing emerald depths, was one of the first masterpieces of Cézanne's mature personal style that was to have implications of great consequence for future art. There is an inner dynamic and a dimension of time to the painting, as if it expressed a process of becoming. This derives from the unstrained and unfinished brushwork and from the gently swaying lines that demarcate colour boundaries.
