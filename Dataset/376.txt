The painting is titeld "The Rose Garden" by Carl Frederik Aagaard from 1877.
This painting is unusual in 19th century art in combining landscape with still-life. In the acutely observed flowers the artist has demonstrated his skills as an observer of nature, but in the more distant landscape. The two figures, possibly lovers, are framed by the forward garland but are almost incidental to the composition.
