The painting is titeld "L'Allegro" by William Edward Frost from 1848.
The painting was inspired by lines 11â€”16 of the poem L'Allegro by John Milton. It was written in conjunction with Il Penseroso, and both poems explore contrasting themes that had been essayed by neo-Platonists during the Renaissance: the former describing the active life and the latter the contemplative. L'Allegro and Il Penseroso date from about 1630 and are in Milton's early lyrical style. Themes from John Milton's oeuvre achieved great popularity during the nineteenth century. They exerted a particular fascination for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.
