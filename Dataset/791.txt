The painting is titeld "Henriette with Large Hat" by Henri Evenepoel from 1899.
Evenepoel's favourite subjects were his family and friends, whom he painted with tenderness and insight. His full-length portraits, usually simply posed against a neutral background, owe much to the example of Edouard Manet and James McNeill Whistler.
