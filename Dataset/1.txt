The painting is titeld "The Return from the Hunt" by Albrecht Adam from 1828.
Albrecht Adam was one of the most celebrated German equestrian and military artists of the early nineteenth century. The present landscape with huntsmen returning from the hunt was commissioned around 1828 as one of a pair of hunting pictures by Felix Georg von Voss, the owner of Schloss Schorssow whose family held substantial estates in Pomerania and Prussia. In the background of the picture is a large, nine-bay country house, shown from the south-east side across the lake identifiable as Schloss Schorssow, built on the banks of Lake Haussee in Pomerania in North-East Germany.
