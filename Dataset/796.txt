The painting is titeld "A Studio in the Batignolles Quarter" by Henri Fantin-Latour from 1870.
In this large painting, exhibited at the 1870 Salon, artists and writers are grouped around Manet, leader of the so-called Batignolles school. The figure apparently sitting for his portrait is Zacharie Astruc, while the five men behind him  are recognizable as (from the left) Renoir, Zola, Edmond Ma√Ætre, Bazille, and Monet. The man behind Manet is Otto Scholderer. The spherical vase was made by Laurent Bouvier (1840-1901), one of the earliest Japanese-influenced potters in Paris. It was included in the painting as a symbol of the interest that the most modern artists were now taking in Japanese art, alongside with a statue of the Greek goddess Minerva, standing for reason and truth.
