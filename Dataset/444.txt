The painting is titeld "The Horse Fair" by Rosa Bonheur from 1851-53.
Bonheurâ€™s The Horse Fair, which she painted and exhibited at the Salon in 1853, was purchased by the American millionaire Cornelius Vanderbilt for $53,600, a record price at the time. It was a resounding success. She was already known for her use of movement, dramatic lighting, and fresh and direct observation, but few of her works achieved the dash and grandeur of The Horse fair, and none attained the same degree of acclaim.
