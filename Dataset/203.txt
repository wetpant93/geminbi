The painting is titeld "Eruption of the Vesuvius" by Johan Christian Clausen Dahl from c. 1823.
In 1820, Dahl made an Italian journey. Staying only briefly in Rome, where the weight of tradition oppressed him, he concentrated on Naples, where the natural scene revealed itself to him in all its multifarity of form and abundance of light. Dahl became completely engrossed in a study of colour nuances and effects of illumination. He had little contact with the German artists working in Italy, meeting frequently only Franz Catel, who may have introduced him to Turner's watercolour landscapes, which were exhibited in Rome in 1819.
