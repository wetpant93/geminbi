The painting is titeld "Young Man by the Sea" by Hippolyte Flandrin from 1836.
This is Flandrin's most popular and recognizable work. Typical of Flandrin, this work uses the nude male figure as a showcase for the stylistic purity of line, modeling, chiaroscuro, and colour. These features are underscored by a mysterious, meditative calm provoked by a moonlit seascape. The youth's body and the environment work together to evoke an aura of poetic lyricism.
