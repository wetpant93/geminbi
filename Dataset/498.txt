The painting is titeld "In a Café" by Gustave Caillebotte from 1880.
Caillebotte often found his subjects near the family home by the river Yerres. In 1880 an acquaintance modelled for his lifesize portrait of a café regular. The subject, technique, colouring, use of space, and subtle deployment of the mirror, all have something of Manet or Degas. But Caillebotte outdid Manet in expressing an entire social psychology in this portrait of a good-humoured, unfooled, slightly crafty man of the lower middle class.
