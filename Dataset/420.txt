The painting is titeld "The Harvest (Breton Landscape)" by Émile Bernard from 1888.
The great simplicity and two-dimensionality of the compositions of the painters of the Pont-Aven school, a group of painters congregated around Paul Gauguin and Émile Bernard, was the result of the influence by folk art and Japanese woodcuts. The Harvest is a good example of these compositions.
