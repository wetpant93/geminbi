The painting is titeld "Chestnut Trees at the Jas de Bouffan in Winter" by Paul Cézanne from 1885-87.
The Jas de Bouffan (House of the Wind), the former summer residence of the Governor of Provence, to the west of Aix, was bought by Cézanne's father in 1859. This estate provided an unfailing source of peace and tranquillity for Cézanne. He may faithfully depict what he sees, but he orders nature to fit his own compositional rules; the chestnut trees are arranged more neatly in the painting than they are in real life.
