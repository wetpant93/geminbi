The painting is titeld "The Barges" by Charles-Fran√ßois Daubigny from 1865.
Daubigny devoted his career exclusively to the landscape. After 1834 he resided most of the year near Barbizon. Given his fondness for representing water, he settled at Auvers-sur-Oise, where from his boat Le Botin, which he had arranged as a studio, he painted the banks of the Oise, exemplified by The Barges.
