The painting is titeld "Madame René de Gas, née Estelle Muston" by Edgar Degas from 1872-73.
The portrait of Estelle Musson, the artist's first cousin, was painted during Degas's 1872-1873 visit to New Orleans. Not long after marrying René de Gas, Estelle had gone blind. Degas shows her gaze by passing us, a vacant gaze bent upon vacancy. It is a discreet and simple portrait of one woman's solitude and isolation.
