The painting is titeld "Haydée, Young Woman in Greek Dress" by Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot from 1870-72.
Emma Dobigny, one of Corot's favourite models, posing in Greek garb, is said to have inspired this melancholy figure. The title of the work may refer to the heroine of Byron's poem Don Juan, or to one of the women loved by the Count of Monte-Cristo in the homonymous novel by Alexandre Dumas. Alternatively, since Corot had a passion for music, it may refer to the heroine of Auber's opera Haydée or the Secret.
