The painting is titeld "Desdemona Retiring to her Bed" by Théodore Chassériau from 1849.
The painting takes its themes from Shakespeare, borrowing the composition that Chassériau established in the eighth of the Othello prints that he engraved in 1844. Unfairly accused of faithlessness by her husband, the Moor Othello, a general in the service of the Venetian Republic, Desdemona has a premonition of her imminent death.
