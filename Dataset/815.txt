The painting is titeld "Self-Portrait" by Károly Ferenczy from 1893.
When István Genthon was writing a study on Károly Ferenczy's portraits, he considered all his portraits (81 out of 351 pictures) which constitute a significant part of his oevre as far as quality is concerned, although he is not counted as a portrait painter. Ferenczy, a master of biblical compositions and bright landscapes, attempted to realize artistic objectives in portraits, too. He often raised the individual to the level of the general, yet his objectivity and realism opposing reconsideration always produced genuine character portrayals.
