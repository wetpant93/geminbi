The painting is titeld "Winter at Moret" by Maurice Galbraith Cullen from 1895.
Maurice Galbraith Cullen was the first to establish the name and fame of Impressionism in Canada, and was the only one of his generation to adopt an Impressionist style rigorously and arrive at a personal manner of art by that route. He acquired a love of plein-air painting in France which remained with him his whole life long. It was in his winter landscapes that he evolved the light effects that are unique to his art, in such paintings as Winter at Moret. Cold, phosphorescent blues predominate, but reddish stray reflections of light radiate a magic warmth.
