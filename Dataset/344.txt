The painting is titeld "The Grossglockner with the Pasterze Glacier" by Thomas Ender from c. 1830.
Archduke John decided to have a pictorial record made of "the entire country of Austria" with the emphasis on geology, mining, botany, and folklore. It was planned that this documentation in the form of painstakingly accurate depictions should be entrusted to his court painters. The first highlight in this record came in about 1830 with Ender's depiction of the upper and lower Pasterze glacier with the Johannisberg. The painting, based on a watercolour, is an important document for glacier research.
