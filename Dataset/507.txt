The painting is titeld "Sloth and Work" by Michele Cammarano from 1863.
The visual contrast sought by Cammarano is clear in placing in the foreground an idle layabout sharply lit so that his every detail can be seen, while in the background the farmers work side by side almost blending together with each other and the landscape.
