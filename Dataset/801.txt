The painting is titeld "Table Corner" by Henri Fantin-Latour from 1872.
This group picture brought together several writers, namely Paul Verlain, Arthur Rimbaud, Elzéar Bonnier, Léon Valade, Émile Blémont, Jean Aicard, Ernst d'Hervilly, and Camille Pelletan. Originally Fantin was planning a companion piece to his Hommage à Delacroix, which was to feature Baudelaire, the influential writer, at its centre. This plan gradually receded in favour of a rather informal grouping of literary figures around a table.
