The painting is titeld "The Pont Neuf, Paris" by Giuseppe Canella from 1830.
Giuseppe Canella is among the illustrious Italian vedutisti. He painted many views of Italian cities - Verona, Milan, Venice, Florence and Rome - but also other European cities such as Madrid or Prague. His views of Paris, performed during his long stay in Paris between 1822 and 1831, earned him great fame before returning to Italy in 1833 where he became a professor at the Academy of Venice. A large topographical precision, evidenced by the present image, contributes to the success of vedute of Canella.
