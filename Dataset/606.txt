The painting is titeld "Les Gorges de Saillon" by Gustave Courbet from 1875.
Although, with its unique rock formation, the landscape appears fantastical, Courbet did in fact depict the scene from life, with recent research pinpointing the exact location as the Grotte des Géants, or 'Cave of Giants' in Saillon, Valais, south-west Switzerland. The fantastical rock formation was not a result of Courbet’s imagination, but a genuine natural feature.
