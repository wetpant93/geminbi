The painting is titeld "Greenwood Lake" by Jasper Francis Cropsey from 1870.
As well as being a painter, Cropsey worked as an architect throughout his life. Painting was nevertheless his more important profession and the one to which he devoted most time. His work, as we can see in this example, is very close in style to that of Cole, and he is in fact considered the most important representative of the second generation of painters of the Hudson River School.
