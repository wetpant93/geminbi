The painting is titeld "Houses at a Millrace" by Ludwig Deppe from 1820.
Ludwig Deppe was a professional secretary who is known from only two signed paintings of 1820. A number of fine early-nineteenth-century views of Berlin were lost in World War II, but one of the best remaining is by Ludwig Deppe. His Houses at a Millrace, like so many eighteenth-century vedute, with its prismatic realism, suggests the use of a camera obscura.
