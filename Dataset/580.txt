The painting is titeld "The Kimono" by William Merritt Chase from c. 1895.
One of the influences Chase absorbed while in Europe was the taste for Japanese prints, something widespread in artistic circles in Paris in the 1870s. Back in America, he made a series of portraits of friends and family in Japanese dress and with Japanese decorative elements, as in the present painting.
