The painting is titeld "Scandinavian Artists Breakfasting at the Caf√© Ledoyen, Paris, on Salon Opening Day" by Hugo Birger from 1886.
The annual Salon provided the Scandinavian artists in Paris with an occasion for festivities, especially if at least one of them had submitted successfully. In the present painting Birger commemorated one such party in 1886. There is nothing Impressionist about the brushwork, but the subject and composition clearly owe something to Manet, Renoir, or Degas.
