The painting is titeld "Young Painter" by Tivadar Csontváry Kosztka from 1898.
The painting evokes the atmosphere of the narrow streets of southern Italy, and was probably made in Naples. The motif of the simple bare-footed young painter drawing a dancing woman on a wall is reminiscent of the young shepherdess of Greek mythology, who draws a portrait of her lover in the sand. This is, perhaps, indicative; Csontváry admired the humility of the craftsman more than the arrogance of professional painters.
