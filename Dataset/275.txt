The painting is titeld "Jacob Wrestling with the Angel (detail)" by Eug√®ne Delacroix from 1854-61.
Jacob Wrestling with the Angel has been read as a summary of Delacroix's life and work. Indeed the leitmotif of his career is the struggle - a spiritual combat - between his aspiration to classicism and his Romantic genius, between his admiration for Racine and his love of Shakespeare.
