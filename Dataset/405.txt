The painting is titeld "The Artist's Studio" by Jean-Frédéric Bazille from 1870.
In this painting the artist set out to paint his studio in the Rue de la Condamine in which he had been working since January 1, 1868. Certain detail are shown very precisely, among them the paintings stacked against or hung on the walls (some of which are his own and others are by his friends Monet and Renoir, who were sharing his studio at the time). Prominent among the paintings is a large composition in the style of Courbet, high on the wall above the sofa, a landscape with two figures, one nude, the other clothed. This may be the Renoir that was rejected by the 1866 Salon.
