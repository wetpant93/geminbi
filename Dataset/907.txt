The painting is titeld "Woman with Flower (Vahine No te Tiare)" by Paul Gauguin from 1891.
Gauguin's disappointment, on his arrival in Papeete, at the effects of colonization which had turned the capital of Tahiti into a Europeanized shanty town, meant that in September he moved to Mataiea, 45 kilometres from the centre, where he painted this work.
