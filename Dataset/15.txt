The painting is titeld "Emperor Franz I of Austria in his Coronation Robes" by Friedrich Von Amerling from 1832.
Amerling was the favourite court painter and from 1830 one of the most popular artist in Vienna. His reputation was based on the life-size portrait of Emperor Franz in 1832. In this portrait the traditional Baroque attributes of a royal portrait are combined with a depiction of "natural man". This is what makes the portrait unconventional.
