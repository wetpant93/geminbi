The painting is titeld "The House of Doctor Gachet in Auvers" by Paul Cézanne from c. 1873.
From late 1872 to the spring of 1874, Cézanne lived in Dr. Paul Gachet's house in Auvers-sur-Oise. Dr. Gachet was the first person to buy pictures from him. In the present painting showing his house the sequence of houses arranged along the curve of the road is striking. Constructivism can already be detected in them, Cézanne's striving for increasing clarity and unity of composition is felt here.
