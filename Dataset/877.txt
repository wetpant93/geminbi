The painting is titeld "Study of a Nude (Suzanne Sewing)" by Paul Gauguin from 1880.
This painting shows the influence of the Impressionist painters on Gauguin. The striking lifesize study combined a number of technical strategies and was a major feature of the 1881 Impressionist show. The heavy flesh of this big-boned pregnant woman, together with her everyday task, share the realistic eye of Degas, while the still-life quality of the setting and the overall conception of the picture suggest Manet's approach. The fine brushwork of the nuanced colouring of light, and the blue and green shadows on the woman's skin, recall Renoir and even more Pissarro.
