The painting is titeld "Bonjour, Monsieur Gauguin" by Paul Gauguin from 1889.
This work was produced in response to the painting by Courbet, the Bonjour Monsieur Courbet, that Gauguin and van Gogh had seen together in the Mus√©e Fabre in Montpellier in December 1888. Gauguin's version, painted several months later, bears little overt resemblance to the original.
