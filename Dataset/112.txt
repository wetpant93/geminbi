The painting is titeld "View of the Colosseum by Night" by Carl Gustav Carus from 1830-32.
Carus was close to Caspar David Friedrich and painted the same Romantic subjects: ruins, mountains, and moonlit nights. But for Carus such themes were an opportunity to admire the beauty of the world more than an occasion for profound contemplation; his paintings tend to delight the eye rather than induce thoughtfulness.
