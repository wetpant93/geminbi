The painting is titeld "The Sea at L'Estaque" by Paul Cézanne from 1876.
In the summer of 1876, Cézanne went to L'Estaque, which was then an idyllic fishing village on a bay in the Mediterranean, to paint landscapes. At that time he had clearly learned a great deal from Pissarro, and added a great deal of his own. This brightly coloured seascapes is serene and formal. The painting is carefully structures, with the strong colours - the terracotta roof tiles, the green foliage, the blue surface of the water - covering the surface of the canvas with an even intensity.
