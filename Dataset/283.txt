The painting is titeld "Louis-Auguste Schwiter" by Eug√®ne Delacroix from 1826-27.
Delacroix's grandest pictures have never left their country of origin. Only in Paris can we fully appreciate the bold reconciliation of beauty with cruelty, sensuality with control, fantasy with observation, modernity with tradition that characterises the art of this influential painter.'
