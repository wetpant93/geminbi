The painting is titeld "Self-Portrait" by Edgar Degas from c. 1855.
Degas, as a young man, was very ambitious in some of his early works, tackling both portraiture and even historical painting. His self-portrait shows the 21-year-old painter as a reserved and even aloof observer. An overall sense of restraint permeates the painting.
