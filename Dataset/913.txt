The painting is titeld "Duel after a Masked Ball" by  Jean-Léon Gérôme from 1857.
Gérôme's father, a goldsmith from Vesoul, discouraged his son from studying to become a painter but agreed, reluctantly, to allow him a trial period in the studio of Paul Delaroche in Paris. He traveled and studied in Italy, elsewhere in Europe, and in Asia Minor. The subjects that he enjoyed most were scenes of nature and animals. He is best known for mythological and history paintings that are typically anecdotal, painstaking, melodramatic, and frequently erotic.
