The painting is titeld "Ballet Class" by Edgar Degas from 1881.
The composition of this extraordinary picture is one of thorough calculation. Down the centre runs a diagonal demarcation separating Jules Perrot, the instructor, two resting dancers and a mother from the three dancers currently exercising. The mother in her flowery dress and straw hat is reading "Le Petit Journal" and taking no interest in the class.
