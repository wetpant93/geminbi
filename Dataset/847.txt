The painting is titeld "Faaturuma (Melancholic)" by Paul Gauguin from 1891.
The subject for Faaturuma may be Tehamana, Gauguin's vahine in Mataiea. The domestic setting, with the painting on the wall, Gauguin's rocking chair which he brought from Papeete and the prominent ring suggest that this may be the nineteenth-century equivalent of a betrothal painting.
