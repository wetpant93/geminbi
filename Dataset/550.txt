The painting is titeld "Plaster Cupid and the "Anatomy"" by Paul Cézanne from c. 1895.
This still-life featuring the Baroque cherub, the plaster cast of which is still in Cézanne's studio, comes to life through its contrasts of rounded forms (the cherub, the apple and the onions) and straight lines (such as the canvases and the edge of the table). It also makes use of the contrast between pale and strong colours.
