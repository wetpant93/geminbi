The painting is titeld "The Sluice-gate at Optevoz (Isère)" by Charles-François Daubigny from 1859.
Daubigny's realistic manners excels in the description of the effects of reflection and transparency. In the Sluice-gate at Optevoz, he also displays his skills in rendering textures. The calm, serene poetry emanating from Daubigny's landscapes stems entirely from nature.
