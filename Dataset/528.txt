The painting is titeld "Afternoon in Naples" by Paul CÃ©zanne from 1872-75.
This openly provocative and sensual painting shows a naked couple in bed, being served with a love potion by an exotic serving-maid. The picture was regarded as an offence against public decency, as well as against the Salon, and of course this unambiguous painting was rejected.
