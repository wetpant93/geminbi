The painting is titeld "Eighteenth-Century Venetian Lady" by Giacomo Favretto from 1887.
The artist has isolated one figure from his studies of eighteenth-century Venetian society and immortalised her in an idealised portrait. The vigorous brush strokes of the dress contrast with the neutral background, conferring an elusive grace of the woman, whose face is hidden in the bold lost-profile view.
