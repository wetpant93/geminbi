The painting is titeld "Panoramic View of the Alps, Les Dents du Midi" by Gustave Courbet from 1877.
This was perhaps Courbet's last painting. At the end of his life, he again and again painted the Ch√¢teau de Chillon on Lake Geneva and views of the Dents du Midi in the Alps. These works were long neglected but demonstrate a complete and unparalleled mastery of the art of landscape.
