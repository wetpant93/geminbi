The painting is titeld "Seated Nude Model" by Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg from 1839.
Eckersberg was the first painter who threw off conventional tones and the pseudo-classical landscape, in exchange for the clear atmosphere and natural outlines of Danish scenery. His landscapesare pure and true, while in his figure-pieces he is conventional.
