The painting is titeld "Self-Portrait in a Peaked Cap" by Paul Cézanne from c. 1873.
Contemporary accounts describe Cézanne as a passionate, restless, yet reserved character. This self-portrait, however, does not give the impression of restrained passions. On the contrary, the artist endows himself with an emphatically imposing, authoritative, imperturbable look, which can be ascribed both to his search for what was stable in any subject and to an early awareness of the scale of his talent.
