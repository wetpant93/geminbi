The painting is titeld "The Trout" by Gustave Courbet from 1871.
When Courbet was transferred to Sainte-PÃ©lagie prison, he obtained permission from the prison director to paint still-lifes with fruit, a genre he had previously neglected. Once free and back in Ornans, he continued this experiment with trout. On one of these paintings, we see the fish on the banks of the river, the hook still in its mouth, while on the bottom of the painting is inscribed in vinculis faciebat ("made while in chains").
