The painting is titeld "The Sleep of King Arthur in Avalon" by Edward Burne-Jones from 1881-98.
Burne-Jones's late work shows him retreating into himself, evolving a mannered and highly personal style and returning to his early interest in Malory. The chief expression of this private world is The Sleep of King Arthur in Avalon (begun 1881), the colossal unfinished canvas on which he was working at his death.
