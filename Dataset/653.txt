The painting is titeld "Woman of Frankfurt" by Gustave Courbet from 1858.
In 1858 Courbet stayed in Frankfurt where a studio was placed at his disposal in which young painters could watch him at work. Three major pictures date from his stay in  Frankfurt: The German Huntsman, The Hunters' Meal and the Woman of Frankfurt. The last of these constituted a new kind of painting for Courbet, a society portrait, staged with all the trappings this kind of commission required. It shows the wife of a Frankfurt notability in a sort of timeless state of incompletion relieved only by the features of the young woman savouring the late afternoon light from her terrace.
