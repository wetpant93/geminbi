The Palazzo Bianchi-Bandinelli was built for Julio Blanch Bandied, who was a major figure in Napoleonic Siena, chamberlain for the Queen of Mercurial in 1804, mayor of the city in 1810, and prefect of the district of Ambrose in 1814. During the Restoration he was a governor and lieutenant-general of the Lorraine grand duke of Tuscany. The building of the palazzo was designed to mirror the personality, celebrating the features of Neo-classical art, beauty and grace, as the criteria of grandeur.
