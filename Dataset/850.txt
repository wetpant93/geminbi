The painting is titeld "Gauguin at His Easel" by Paul Gauguin from 1885.
From November 1884 to June 1885 Gauguin lived in Copenhagen with his wife and family, and it was there that he painted this self-portrait. His letters to friends in Paris chronicle what was for him a difficult period - he missed the cultural life of Paris, disliked the Danes, his wife's family in particular, and the harsh climate meant that he could do little work in the open air. Increasingly he was forced to work indoors, without a model, and his subject matter betrays these constraints. His work became increasingly premeditated. However, in the execution, particularly in the flickering brushwork, this painting is still close to the work of his Impressionist years.
