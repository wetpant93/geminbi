The painting is titeld "Sunshine" by Emile Claus from 1899.
As a result of their approach to Impressionism, Belgian artists occasionally juxtaposed native Flemish styles with imported Impressionist styles derived from the French. One of the major exponents of the more French-oriented line was Emile Claus, who painted in the style of Monet. Paintings such as Sunshine and A Corner of My Garden show how intensely he grappled with the phenomenon of light and different atmospheric conditions. His subjects, frequently landscapes, recall Monet.
