The painting is titeld "The Champion Single Sculls (Max Schmitt in a Single Scull)" by Thomas Eakins from 1871.
In this complex, haunting work, Eakins's passion for sports is suffused with a lyrical response to subtle qualities of light and to the rhythmic placement of forms in deep space. A keen rower, Eakins produced several boating pictures. This painting commemorates the victory of Max Schmitt (1843â€“1900), an attorney and skilled amateur rower, in an important race held on the Schuylkill River in October 1870. Eakins depicted himself in a scull beyond Schmitt in the middle distance.
