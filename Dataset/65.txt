The painting is titeld "The Bay of Rapallo" by Karl Blechen from 1829-30.
After 1829-29 Blechen's impressions of his travels in Italy were already taking him to the verge of naturalism.Occasionally his effects are theatrical, but these derive from the drama of nature itself, like the coming thunderstorm in this picture.
