The painting is titeld "Nativity (Te Tamari No Atua)" by Paul Gauguin from 1896.
After the birth of his illegitimate children, the themes of birth and family life appear in Gauguin's art. The present painting borrows a Christian motif to express the artist's experience of fatherhood. The lying native woman with a halo around her head is perhaps the lover of the artist.
