The painting is titeld "Cycle of The Legend of St Hubert" by Maurice Denis from 1897.
The artist's first major break came in 1895 when the French writer and Catholic right-wing politician, Baron Denys Cochin (1851-1922), commissioned Denis to paint a mural for his office based on the theme of the legend of St Hubert. Hubertus or Hubert (c. 656-727) was a Christian saint who became the first bishop of Li√®ge in 708 A.D. Legend holds that on a Good Friday morning, while the faithful were in church, Hubert was hunting in the forest. As he pursued a magnificent stag or hart, the animal turned and Hubert was astounded to see a crucifix floating between its antlers. He heard a voice saying: "Hubert, unless thou turnest to the Lord and leadest a holy life, thou shalt quickly go down into Hell." Hubert dismounted and prostrated himself, and after asking "Lord, what wouldst Thou have me do?" is told, "Go and seek Lambert, and he will instruct you." Hubert is the patron saint of hunters, mathematicians, opticians, and metalworkers.
