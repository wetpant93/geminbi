The painting is titeld "Self-Portrait" by Pierre Bonnard from 1889.
Bonnard graduated when he was 21, and he was sworn in as a barrister in 1889. In the meantime, he was already drawing and painting, having enrolled at the Acad√©mie Julian, Paris, in 1887. In an attractive Self-portrait of 1889 (private collection), he depicted himself not in barrister's robes but as a young painter, holding a palette.
