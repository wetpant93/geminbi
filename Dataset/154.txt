The painting is titeld "The Hay Wain" by John Constable from 1821.
The view is of the millpond at Flatford on the River Stour. Flatford Mill was a watermill for grinding corn, operated by the Constable family for nearly a hundred years. It still survives and is about a mile from Constable's birthplace at East Bergholt, Suffolk. The house on the left also survives; in Constable's time it was occupied by tenant farmer Willy Lott.
