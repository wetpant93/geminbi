The painting is titeld "The Studio" by Odoardo Borrani from 1850-74.
Interiors and still-lifes are rarely found among the Macchiaioli artists, who generally preferred landscapes and figure paintings. This intimate glimpse into the artist's studio displays a carefree assembly of textiles, pottery, furniture, and a guitar placed casually on the sofa. The unusual perspective indicates that Borrani's attention is focused more on the effects of light and colour than on the depicted space.
