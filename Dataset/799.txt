The painting is titeld "Hommage to Delacroix" by Henri Fantin-Latour from 1864.
This painting is the first in a series of pictures that Fantin-Latour painted of friends, which, along with his delicate still-lifes of flowers was to bring him fame. It was painted one year after the death of Delacroix, who appears as a portrait in the centre of the picture, honoured by a bouquet of flowers placed in front of it. Fantin-Latour painted the portrait from a photograph that had been published ten years previously.
