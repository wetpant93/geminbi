The painting is titeld "The Quarry (La Curée)" by Gustave Courbet from 1856.
This painting was the first in a long series of animal paintings with hunters, stags, red and roe deer, horses, dogs, foxes and snow-scenes. During his frequent stays in Franche-Comté, Courbet liked to go hunting and made of this activity a subject from which he drew wholly unprecedented results.
