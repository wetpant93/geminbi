The painting is titeld "Portrait of Juliette Courbet" by Gustave Courbet from 1844.
Courbet frequently painted his family and his sisters and father are present in all his major works. Juliette played a particular role in his life. She was an important figure in his entourage and was, after his death, unreservedly devoted to his memory, even attempting to censure traits of Courbet's character and aspects of his career.
