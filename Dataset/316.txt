The painting is titeld "The Death of the Sons of King Edward in the Tower" by Paul Delaroche from 1831.
Delaroche's early work consists mainly of subjects from the Old Testament, while later he chose subjects from French and English history. This work, taken from English history, led to an unusual development.  Where other painters frequently worked from theatrical designs, the theatrical nature of this painting led to the image being put back on to the stage. The painting arose so much interest that Casimir Delavigne felt impelled to write a tragedy with a stage set built exactly like Delaroche's painting.
