The painting is titeld "The Stream at Brème" by Gustave Courbet from 1866.
Landscape painting is an important area of Courbet's oeuvre. He painted the landscapes where he lived or which he visited. The Stream at Brème shows a spot near Ornans where Courbet was born and spent his youth, and to which he returned many times. In this canvas the vigorous palette and broken brushstrokes are particularly striking.
