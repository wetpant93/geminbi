The painting is titeld "Mendel Levin Nathanson's Elder Daughters, Bella and Hanna" by Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg from 1820.
During the years around 1820, Eckersberg was busy painting portraits of the affluent citizens of Copenhagen. The artist's greatest patron during his young years, the merchant Mendel Levin Nathanson, commissioned two large family portraits. In one of the two works he painted Nathanson's two oldest daughters, Bella and Hanna, in a sparingly furnished drawing room with simple paneling and furniture, including a table bearing a parrot's cage.
