The painting is titeld "Autumn" by Frederic Edwin Church from 1875.
Autumn landscapes were often painted by Church, who exploited the possibilities autumn gave for brilliant colouring, from the blue sky in the upper left to the intense reds of the leaves. Characteristic of Church and other artists of his school is the light source coming from the centre of the canvas, which illuminates the scene from the background in a deliberately theatrical way.
