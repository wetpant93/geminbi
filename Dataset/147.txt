The painting is titeld "Flatford Mill from a Lock on the Stour" by John Constable from c. 1811.
This picture is one of Constable's oil sketches which are bravura displays of a thickly loaded brush or palette knife, worked at speed in rich colours, setting out bold masses and forms as well as transient effects of weather or time.
