The painting is titeld "Resting on the Banks of the Tiber" by Paul Delaroche from 1834-43.
Delaroche's work is characterized by scrupulous accuracy in historical detail and a technique that incorporates a glossy finish. His compositions are highly theatrical, imitating waxworks or stage tableaux. He sometimes made wax or plaster models to help him achieve the best arrangement of the figures.
