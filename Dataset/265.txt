The painting is titeld "Christ on the Cross (sketch)" by Eug√®ne Delacroix from 1845.
The reign of Louis-Philippe saw a return to the great tradition of French religious painting. Commissions were forthcoming. When Delacroix came to paint one of the most anguished representations of the crucifixion, his Christ on the Cross, it was to Rubens and his Christ on the Cross (Le Coup de Lance) that he returned.
