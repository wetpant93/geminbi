The painting is titeld "Portrait of a Young Girl" by Friedrich Von Amerling from 1837.
Amerling worked in a style that combined the elegance of British portraiture with the realism of the Viennese Biedermeier tradition. His sitters included not only members of the royal family but also the wealthy upper classes, prominent citizens and even fellow artists. He also produced a number of portrait studies such as this picture, which show just the sitter's head. These studies are notable for their spontaneity and immediacy.
