The painting is titeld "Fishing Party on Long Island Sound off New Rochelle" by James Goodwyn Clonney from 1847.
Like Cole, Clonney came from a British family which emigrated to the New World in search of the opportunities which it offered. He was also one of the artists to develop a new and truly American style of art, reflecting the interests and reality of a people who at this time were acquiring their national identity. While Cole began the genre of American landscape, Clonney paved the way for genre painting. The present work is a good example of this type of painting, which aims to reflect the peaceful everyday life of the East Coast in a direct way.
