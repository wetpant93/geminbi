The painting is titeld "The Cotton Exchange in New Orleans" by Edgar Degas from 1873.
In the fall of 1872, Degas traveled to America with his brother Ren√©, in order to visit two other brothers who settled as cotton traders in New Orleans. He remained there until April 1873. He found the exoticism of the "colonial" society of New Orleans very attractive.
