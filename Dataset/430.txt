The painting is titeld "Island of the Dead (fifth version)" by Arnold Böcklin from 1886.
This is the last of five versions of a painting commissioned from Böcklin; it was purchased by the museum immediately after its completion. The artist works here with metaphors that symbolize the sublimity of nature compared to the existence of humans. The rocky island protrudes monumentally from the calm sea. It seems to be a cemetery created by nature and stands for something lasting. In the middle of the symmetrically arranged composition, dark cypress trees tower up, the tops of which move slightly in the cloudy sky. A boat with a person wrapped in a white cloth standing in front of a coffin is gliding towards the island. With the signature on the lintel bar of a grave opening on the right in the picture, Böcklin created his imaginary grave during his lifetime.
