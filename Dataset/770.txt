The painting is titeld "Gorge" by Gustave Doré from 1878.
Doré is best known today for his book illustrations, but he himself was most committed to his work as a painter. In 1873-74 he visited Scotland, which inspired him to produce a number of landscapes, including this depiction of a steep gorge. This is a typical example of late Romanticism, a grandiose panoramic mountain landscape, its vast scale indicated by the tiny trees and animals on the slopes.
