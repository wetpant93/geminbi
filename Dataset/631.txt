The painting is titeld "Self-Portrait with Black Dog" by Gustave Courbet from 1842-44.
One of Courbet's earliest self-portraits, it surprises the spectator with the determination of the young man, his youth and the emphasis placed on the hand in the foreground. The Mannerist aesthetic is reminiscent of the self-portrait in a convex mirror by the Renaissance painter Parmigianino.
