The painting is titeld "The Intrigue" by James Ensor from 1890.
Ensor's Intrigue is certainly intriguing. A woman has got her man. She presents her 'conquest' with a gesture of her hand. In her other hand, she holds a small bouquet. Are they married? Perhaps. Grotesquely comical, sinister faces surround the couple. A coarse-faced woman carries a doll on her shoulder. Or is it a dead child? She points to the man - his fate is uncertain. A skull with a loose jawbone observes the scene. Intense, aggressive colour contrasts and rough, nervous brushstrokes intensify the ugly atmosphere.
