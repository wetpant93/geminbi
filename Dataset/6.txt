The painting is titeld "View of the Palatine Chapel" by Luigi Ademollo from 1800s.
The decorations of the chapel in the Palazzo Pitti are due to Luigi Ademollo, who painted the religious panels as well as the simulated bas-reliefs in grisaille technique of the organ balcony. They represent the Neoclassical taste of the early years of the nineteenth century, when for some time Napoleon had installed members of his family as the rulers of Tuscany.
