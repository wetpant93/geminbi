The painting is titeld "At the Milliner's" by Edgar Degas from 1882.
Degas painted several pictures set in millinery shops. The milliners are caught in the most absurd positions, surrounded by brightly coloured hats and slanting mirrors often placed at the edge of the painting. They are completely absorbed by the fitting of hats and lose all individual dignity.
