The painting is titeld "Commemoration of Canova in the Scuola Grande della Carit√†" by Giuseppe Borsato from 1822.
The Neo-classical movement in Venice included a number of artists of note, who often painted the cultivated and refined  decorations for buildings erected or renovated in the period. This scene depicts the funerary ceremony held in honour of Antonio Canova on October 16, 1822. Leopoldo Cicognara, director of the Accademia and a leading exponent of Neo-classicism in Italy, is portrayed in the act of declaiming the funeral oration. A copy of Titian's Assumption provides a symbolic bridge that links the recently deceased artist to his illustrious predecessor.
