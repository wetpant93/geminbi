The painting is titeld "The Railway Cutting" by Paul Cézanne from c. 1870.
Cézanne painted this ordinary-looking landscape near Aix in the bright colour of the Impressionists, but without creating atmosphere by resolving the forms. This is the first of his paintings to feature the mountain he loved so much, Mont Saint-Victoire.
