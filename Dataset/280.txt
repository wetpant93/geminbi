The painting is titeld "Liberty Leading the People (detail)" by Eug√®ne Delacroix from 1830.
Contemporary criticism focused on the eroticism of the bare breasts, the dirty skin and the suggestion of hair at the armpits. These were taken to indicate that the goddess of liberty was a woman of the people, a fishwife, a Venus of the streets and not a countess from the Faubourg Saint-Germain.
