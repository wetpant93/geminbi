The painting is titeld "Cross in the Mountains (Tetschen Altar)" by Caspar David Friedrich from 1808.
If nothing more were known of the painter, this painting, the so-called 'Tetschen Altar' would command attention for its boldness in creating a devotional image from the materials of landscape. It is both the first masterpiece of one of the greatest Romantic landscape painters and a manifesto for the art of landscape itself. It exemplifies two important achievements of early Romanticism: the elevation of nature to a kind of religion, and of landscape to equal or surpass history painting.
