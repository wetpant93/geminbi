The painting is titeld "Nocturnal Celebrations in Via Eugenia at Venice" by Ippolito Caffi from 1840.
Nocturnal celebrations here give the artist the opportunity to transform the city under the dazzling light of the fireworks, offering the observer an unusual vision of streets and palazzos cloaked in a magical, almost supernatural atmosphere.
