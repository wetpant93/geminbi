The painting is titeld "Birdsong" by Károly Ferenczy from 1893.
While painters of the Nagybánya school were first attracted to painting alfresco by  the beautiful mountains, Károly Ferenczy had started doing so during his Munich stay.  "Birdsong" is Ferenczy's first step to leave Basten-Lepage's "delicate naturalism" for his own style. The picture is free from details. The random appearance of impressionism in details of nature and capturing atmospheres, lights and colours hastily painted could not be more unusual for him.
