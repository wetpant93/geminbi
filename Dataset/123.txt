The painting is titeld "Orientalist Interior: Nude in a Harem" by Théodore Chassériau from 1850-52.
Women at their toilettes had been a popular theme since the Renaissance, and orientalist scenes, usually in Turkish costume, had circulated since that time. These scenes had usually been boudoir pictures, however, private paintings and therefore private subjects. In the nineteenth century these subjects enter more frequently into the public sphere. Views of the (wholly invented) Harem offered a sexually exoticized, and some argue inherently politicised, new subject in Orientalism, a new genre.
