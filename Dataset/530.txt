The painting is titeld "Bouquet of Flowers in a Blue Vase" by Paul Cézanne from 1873-75.
Cézanne rarely exhibited or signed his works. His signature on this still-life likely indicates that it was sent to the Impressionists' third exhibition in 1877. Soon the canvas was bought by collector Victor Chocquet, who appreciated its dense pastose painting and completeness.
