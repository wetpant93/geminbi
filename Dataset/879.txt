The painting is titeld "Tahitian Pastorals" by Paul Gauguin from 1892.
In a letter to his friend Daniel de Monfreid in Paris, written in December 1892, Gauguin described this work and two smaller canvases: "I believe they are my best, and since it will be the first of January in several days I have dated one, the best, 1893. Exceptionally, I gave it a French title: Pastorales Tahitiennes, not finding a corresponding title in the language of the South Seas."
