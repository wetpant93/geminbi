The painting is titeld "Gossip (Les Parau Parau)" by Paul Gauguin from 1891.
The first paintings Gauguin produced in Tahiti prove that he found what he was seeking. In this painting a group of local people can be seen, sitting in semicircle, resting and chatting. The vanity of words - the title in the native language means "words, words" - falls silent in the pacifying music of colour.
