The painting is titeld "Sunday in the Bois de Boulogne" by Henri Evenepoel from 1891.
In this unusual composition, the Sunday walkers in the Bois de Boulogne seem to be walking out of the canvas to right and left, at different speed, as in a snapshot. The left edge of the picture is audaciously cropped, and left of the centre there is an empty space that seems to be pushing the actual movement out to the sides. Compositionally, this highly idiosyncratic picture recalls Toulouse-Lautrec.
