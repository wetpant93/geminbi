The painting is titeld "Old Road to Auvers" by Norbert Goeneutte from 1892.
The small town of Auvers-sur-Oise became, during the late 19th century, a landscape subject for some of the period's greatest artists. CÃ©zanne, van Gogh, Guillaumin, in addition to Goeneutte, all captured views of the town's country roads and thatched roof cottages.
