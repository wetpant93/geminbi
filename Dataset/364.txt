The painting is titeld "Dolmen in the Snow" by Caspar David Friedrich from 1807.
The dolmen portrayed here is probably one which stood near GÃ¼tzkow, and which was removed between 1825 and 1829. Together with his drawing master Quistorp, Friedrich made several excursions to prehistoric burial sites.
