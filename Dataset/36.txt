The painting is titeld "The Begas Family" by Carl The Elder Begas from 1821.
At the time a new-old attitude to marriage was popular, as the idea of the patriarch in the family gained ground with the idea of the Fatherland. The knitted stocking conquered the marriage chamber, but also many a portrait. Carl Begas used this motif in his group portrait of his family.
