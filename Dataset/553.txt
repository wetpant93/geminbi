The painting is titeld "Portrait of Ambroise Vollard" by Paul Cézanne from 1899.
Ambroise Vollard (1865-1939) was an art dealer in Paris, one of the most glittering figures on the art dealing scene of 1900. In Paris in 1895 he staged a major exhibition of Cézanne's works after a 20-year absence. One year later he signed an exclusive contract with Gauguin, who was living in Tahiti, and became the only gallery-owner in Paris to offer the artist's South Sea paintings for sale.
