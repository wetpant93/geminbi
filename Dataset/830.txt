The painting is titeld "Démasquée" by Akseli Gallen-Kallela from 1888.
This picture was painted in Paris in 1888. The model is just taking a break from posing, and the portrait has captured her at rest - in an unpretentious yet sensual relaxed position, lightly mocking. The artist has caught her weary smile, the way she is rubbing her hurting feet, the negligent gestures of her hands and arms on the sofa-top blanket, and a black half-mask she is holding in her right hand.
