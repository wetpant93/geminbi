The painting is titeld "Landscape" by Richard Parkes Bonington from c. 1825.
Following the lead of Dutch artists, Bonnington devoted most of the space in his landscapes to delicate, often bright harmonies of sky and water. Such compositions erode the strict classical scheme, unrepentantly sacrificing rational construction in favour of sensation.
