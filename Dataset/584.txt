The painting is titeld "Summer" by Guglielmo Ciardi from c. 1879.
The oppressive heat of a summer afternoon, released by the parched earth and echoed by the haystacks, is rendered in thick brush strokes that recall the technique of the Macchiaioli. This is the mature period of Ciardi's activity, which was to have great influence on contemporary and subsequent painting in the Veneto.
