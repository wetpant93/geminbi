The painting is titeld "Woman Leaning on an Elbow beside a Vase of Flowers" by Edgar Degas from 1865.
Degas abandoned historical subjects in favour of close observation of modern life. In Woman Leaning on an Elbow beside a Vase of Flowers he introduces the viewer into a typical middle-class home in the country, possibly that of his friends the Valpin√ßons in southern Normandy. His model is relaxing informally after gathering this large bouquet in her garden, the gloves that protected her hands from scratches now carelessly laid on the table beside the water jug.
