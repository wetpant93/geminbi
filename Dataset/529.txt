The painting is titeld "Bather" by Paul Cézanne from 1885-87.
Cézanne preferred using photographs or sketches rather than nude models because he felt uncomfortable in their presence. This painting, too, is based on a photograph. It is unusual for one of Cézanne's bathers to dominate the picture as much as this one does.
