The painting is titeld "Rocks at L'Estaque" by Paul Cézanne from 1882-85.
In the first half of the 1880s, Cézanne painted in L'Estaque. The paintings from this period include the present landscape, in which Cézanne is particularly interested in the rocky pinnacles, scarred by erosion and covered in sparse, wiry vegetation. He has used a very limited palette in this painting: bluish-grey for the rocks, green for the vegetation, and ochre for the soil, but there are complex tonalities within this small range of colours.
