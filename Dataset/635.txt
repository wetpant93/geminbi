The painting is titeld "The Bathers" by Gustave Courbet from 1853.
The picture illustrates a theme of nude bathing much taken up by the classical painters. But its opulent, baroque vision offered an alternative to academic paintings well before Manet showed his model Victorine Meurent in DÃ©jeuner sur l'herbe (1863).
