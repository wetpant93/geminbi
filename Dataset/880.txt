The painting is titeld "Te avae no Maria (The Month of Mary)" by Paul Gauguin from 1899.
Every May the Catholic Church holds special services dedicated to the Virgin Mary that coincide with traditional European spring festivals of pagan origin. Gauguin expresses this theme of the unity of religion and nature in images evoked by the ancient Buddhist reliefs of the Borobudur temple on the island of Java, which he discovered for himself while still in France.
