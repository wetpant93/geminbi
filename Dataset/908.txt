The painting is titeld "Women on the Seashore (Motherhood)" by Paul Gauguin from 1899.
One of Gauguin's most tranquil paintings, this maternal scene is filled with an undisrupted harmony. It was created during the brief moment of light after Pahura, the artist's second Tahitian companion, bore him a son, whom they named Emile.
