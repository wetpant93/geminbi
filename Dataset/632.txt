The painting is titeld "Self-Portrait with Striped Collar" by Gustave Courbet from 1854.
Though Courbet was inspired and correspondingly successful in his treatment of groups, he did not stop painting more intimate pictures such as the last self- portrait, Self-Portrait with Striped Collar. It was painted at Montpellier and suggests a certain weariness with the genre; it was indeed, the last self-portrait that he painted for some twenty years.
