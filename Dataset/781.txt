The painting is titeld "Astonishment of the Mask Wouse" by James Ensor from 1889.
Masks are James Ensor's trademark. From 1880 onwards, they appear regularly in his paintings and drawings. The same ones, in many cases, and often even in the identical position. In almost each case, they are carnival masks that his mother sold in her souvenir shop. Several of them can be seen in old photographs of Ensor in his studio. He might have posed models using masks and costumes.
