The painting is titeld "Trust in God" by Lorenzo Bartolini from 1833.
Bartolini would often attempt symbolic religious themes. The most notable of these is Trust in God, which the artist intended as a personification of faith. The nudity of the adolescent figure was meant to represent the human soul placing its trust in the Lord, but much of the sculpture's appeal doubtless stems from its undertone of eroticism.
