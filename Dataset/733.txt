The painting is titeld "The Parade" by Edgar Degas from 1866-68.
Many of Degas's drawings and studies of movement after 1860 are inspired by race-course scenes. His paintings of horse races reflect how much he was influenced by the works of famous painters such as Théodore Géricault and Ernst Meissonier. He was similarly influenced by Japanese woodblock prints. The asymmetry of this composition derives from Oriental art.
