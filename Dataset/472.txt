The painting is titeld "Ruined House" by Domenico Bresolin from before 1859.
Constantly engaged in an almost phenomenological study of physical reality, Domenico Bresolin engages to confer dignity and merit even on an abandoned building that lacks any attraction. The given is investigated with a minute attention comparable to the technique of photographic representation, with which the artist was experimenting from the middle of the century onward.
