The painting is titeld "The Pont Neuf and the Quai des Orfèvres, from the Place du Pont Neuf" by Hippolyte-Camille Delpy from 1875.
This scene in the early morning is an example of Delpy's interest in Parisian daily life, concentrating on the activities of ordinary people. In the distance, across the left bank we can see the dome of the Panthéon, and beyond it the spire of the church of Saint Severin. The building at left has been refaced, giving it a more elegant appearance, but otherwise the view today is almost unchanged.
