The painting is titeld "The Ironers" by Edgar Degas from c. 1884.
Degas's paintings of the working class have a social content. He took up themes treated earlier by Honor√© Daumier and painted women ironing, washerwomen, milliners. In contrast to Daumier, Degas saw no heroism in everyday modern work. His Ironers are of frightening ugliness. Their work is dull. The straining effort of the woman on the right contrasts with the brief repose of the woman on the left. These working women are portrayed as harridans.
