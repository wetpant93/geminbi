The painting is titeld "House and Farm at Jas de Bouffan" by Paul Cézanne from 1885-87.
The Jas de Bouffan (House of the Wind), the former summer residence of the Governor of Provence, to the west of Aix, was bought by Cézanne's father in 1859. This estate provided an unfailing source of peace and tranquillity for Cézanne. In this picture, the house seems to be drawing the sun into itself, almost turning to face it.
