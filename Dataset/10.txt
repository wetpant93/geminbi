The painting is titeld "Satire on Romantic Suicide" by Leonardo Alenza Y Nieto from 1839.
Alenza y Nieto is often described as the last of the followers of Goya, in whose Caprichos and drawings he found inspiration for the genre scenes for which he became best known. His two canvases entitled Satire on Romantic Suicide (Museo Rom√°ntico, Madrid) are perhaps the most characteristic of his works.
