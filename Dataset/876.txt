The painting is titeld "Still-Life with Three Puppies" by Paul Gauguin from 1888.
In 1888, Gauguin returned to France from Martinique. He stayed a second time at Pont-Aven, where a new and decisive meeting with Ã‰mile Bernard brought forward a new doctrine about painting. He broke away from Impressionism and applied the cloisonnism which he developed together with Bernard.
