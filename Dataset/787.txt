The painting is titeld "Tribulations of St Anthony" by James Ensor from 1887.
One of Ensor's earliest fantastical paintings, this work recreates the familiar story of St Anthony battling a world of temptations (embodied by the woman at the far left). Ensor described his version of the narrative as one in which "the bizarre prevails" as Hell expels menacing sea creatures and grotesque monsters haphazardly joined together within a colourful, loosely rendered landscape.
