The painting is titeld "Michelangelo in his Studio" by Eug√®ne Delacroix from 1849-50.
Delacroix seems here to identify with Michelangelo, whom he greatly admired, finding in him a symbol of his own predicament as a misunderstood artist. Michelangelo is seen wearing a red scarf, an accoutrement for which Delacroix was famous.
