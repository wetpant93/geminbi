The painting is titeld "Alaide Banti in White Dress" by Giovanni Boldini from 1866.
Boldini brought a revolutionary approach to portrait painting, applying broad areas of tone and colour and of light and dark patterns along with a low vantage point. He also introduced a novel treatment of the background as an ambience displaying the sitter's milieu and interests. The sitter of the present painting was the twelve-year-old daughter of fellow painter Cristiano Banti. During a prolonged stay as a guest in the Banti home, Boldini became romantically involved with her. For unknown reasons their marriage plans were later abruptly cancelled.
