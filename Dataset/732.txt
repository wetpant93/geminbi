The painting is titeld "The Orchestra at the Opera" by Edgar Degas from c. 1870.
After the sporting world of the turf as a source of inspiration, Degas turned toward the stage and the ballet. These seemingly different themes have one major element in common: movement. They both allowed Degas to explore that which interested him the most: a body in motion. He had a passion for the world of music and opera and his paintings of the stage broke new ground.
