The painting is titeld "Water Basin at Versailles" by Richard Parkes Bonington from c. 1826.
Bonnington was principally a watercolorist and lithographer, one of a loose association of English and French artists in Paris. His work was prized for its light touch and spontaneity, and also for its brightness. Water Basin at Versailles is a fine example.
