The painting is titeld "The Cellist" by Paul Gauguin from 1894.
This imposing portrait of a seated cellist is one of the last of Gauguin's French works. It was painted in the first months of 1894. Its curious title, Upaupa Schneklud, inscribed on the canvas at top left, combines the sitter's surname with a reference to Gauguin's first Tahitian sojourn.
