The painting is titeld "Haymaking" by Julien Dupré from 1892.
Julien Dupré is considered to be one of the leading exponents of the second generation of Realist painters; a group that also includes Leon Lhermitte, Jules Bastien-Lepage and Pascal Dagnan-Bouveret.  Like Jean-François Millet and Jules Breton, before them, these artists devoted their artistic careers to the depiction of the toils of the French peasant - often seen hard at work in the fields.
