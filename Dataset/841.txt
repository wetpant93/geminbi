The painting is titeld "By the Pond" by Paul Gauguin from 1887.
After his stay in Brittany, in 1887 Gauguin went to the island of Martinique in the Lesser Antilles in the eastern Caribbean Sea. The present painting was executed there. In this painting he applied the technique of the Impressionists. In the strong sunshine of Martinique his colours became much brighter than in Brittany.
