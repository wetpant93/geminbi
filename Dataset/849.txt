The painting is titeld "Four Breton Women Dancing" by Paul Gauguin from 1886.
In 1886, Gauguin settled in Pont-Aven, a small coastal village in Brittany. Here he devoted himself entirely to painting. In the present painting the depiction of local costumes and dancing shows the painter's interest in Breton peasant life.
