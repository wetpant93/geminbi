The painting is titeld "Fields at the Edge of the Village, Bois-le-Roi" by Hippolyte-Camille Delpy from 1876.
Delpy was inspired by Daubigny and the Barbizon School. The Barbizon School held that the notion of colour must be added to the classical theory of harmony between tones and values. Under the influence of the Impressionists, Delpy realized the important role of colour, which he used to achieve a brighter truth in his paintings.
