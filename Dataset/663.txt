The painting is titeld "The Grave of Keats" by Walter Crane from 1873.
In 1871 Crane married Mary Frances Andrews, and during a protracted Italian honeymoon, he evolved a personal style of gouache landscape painting. He reduced the range of colour and simplified the forms of the landscape to convey the sun-baked but luxuriant character of the Italian countryside.
