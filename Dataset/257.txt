The painting is titeld "A Moroccan Saddling a Horse" by Eug√®ne Delacroix from 1855.
Delacroix's Romanticism is virtually the opposite of German artists' interpretation of the style. But his interest in depicting animals - the lions in the grip of death's fury, the spirited horses, alongside which the humans seem like frozen statues - connects him with the prose of German Romantic writers, in which the theme of the human in the beast and the bestial in the human plays a substantial role.
