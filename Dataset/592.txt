The painting is titeld "Reclining Nude" by Lovis Corinth from 1899.
Corinth's Reclining Nude demonstrated a thoroughly natural use of Impressionist style for figure painting. German Impressionism's major works tended to be painted not in the landscape area (as with the French) but rather in nudes and portraits.
