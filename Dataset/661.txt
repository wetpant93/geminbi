The painting is titeld "The Bridge of Life" by Walter Crane from 1884.
Many of Crane's allegorical paintings of the 1880s, such as The Bridge of Life (1884) and Freedom (1885; both untraced), suffered from sombre moods and banal symbolism and were criticized on these accounts. The painter's draughtsmanship became less precise and his treatment of figures crude.
