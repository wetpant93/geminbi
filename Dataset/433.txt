The painting is titeld "Island of the Dead (third version)" by Arnold Böcklin from 1883.
The Island of the Dead is one of Böcklin's most popular pictorial inventions. He achieved this effect by combining a few motifs into an impressive mood formula. The image motifs of island, water, castle or villa by the sea were already present in his work long before. But here they are, as it were, condensed into a worldview. The place depicted is eerie, the view through the stairs does not penetrate into the dark interior. The strict symmetry, the calm vertical and horizontal lines, the circular island surrounded by high rock walls, together with the magical lighting, create an atmosphere of the solemn and sublime, evoke the feeling of silence and rapture. The motionless surface of the water and the boat with the white wrapped figure behind the coffin add a melancholy tone.
