The painting is titeld "Awaiting An Audience" by Willem Geets from 1886.
'Awaiting An Audience' stands as a bridge between Geets's epic English exhibition debut of 1884 at the Royal Academy summer show, 'A Martyr in the Sixteenth Century', and his much more intimate and commercial works such as 'Writing a Letter' and 'Polishing Brass and Copper'.
