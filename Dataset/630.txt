The painting is titeld "Self-Portrait at Sainte-Pélagie" by Gustave Courbet from c. 1872.
Courbet's commitment to politics led to a period of imprisonment. He immortalized this part of his life in Self-Portrait at Sainte-Pélagie. Immediately after his arrest in June 1871, he was accused of having taken part in the Paris Commune, the last of the nineteenth-century revolutions in France. During his trial, Courbet was accused of having taken part in the destruction of the colonne Vendôme, which had been erected by Napoleon I to commemorate the victories of the Grande Armée. Found guilty in 1871, Courbet found himself worse off again after his appeal in 1874.
