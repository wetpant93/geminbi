The painting is titeld "Winter at Barbizon" by Ion Andreescu from 1881.
In Andreescu's landscapes the rich colours of grass, foliage, rocks, and sky, and the structural appearance of trees in the woods at Fontainebleau, exerted a continual attraction. But Andreescu was also proficient at intricately nuanced whites, greys and light ochres in a village scene such as Winter at Barbizon, exhibited at the 1881 Paris Salon.
