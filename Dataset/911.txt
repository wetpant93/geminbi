The painting is titeld "Fra Angelico in the Refectory of San Domenico" by Lorenzo Gelati from c. 1879.
Lorenzo Gelati was inspired by Vasari's description of the devout friar. With palette in hand and head lowered in prayer, the pious Angelico is shown kneeling before his fresco of the crucified Christ in the convent of San Domenico in Fiesole, where he was a friar.
