The painting is titeld "Does He Love Me?" by Károly Brocky from after 1847.
Brocky had a great interest in past artistic tradition as proven by this genre picture. It quotes suggestively the painting manner of the Dutch painters of the 17th century. It is almost like a companion piece of Gerard Terborch' Woman Playing Lute (Gemäldegalerie, Kassel).
