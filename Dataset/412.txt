The painting is titeld "Reading Woman in the Forest" by Gyula Benczúr from 1875.
Benczúr, a master of great interiors, leads us out of the world of furniture and museum pieces: we find ourselves in nature. This picture proves that its master shared the love of nature of the Barbizon painters. This charming idyll in the forest always remains to be a surprise for the spectator whenever he has a look at it.
