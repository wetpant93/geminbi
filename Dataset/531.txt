The painting is titeld "Boy in a Red Vest" by Paul Cézanne from 1888-90.
The sitter was a young Italian whom Cézanne painted four times in relaxed poses. He was at ease with the world, as his pose suggests. For purposes of compositional balance, Cézanne felt justified in making the youth's right arm unnaturally long.
