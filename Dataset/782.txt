The painting is titeld "Christ's Entry into Brussels in 1889" by James Ensor from 1888.
James Ensor took on religion, politics, and art in this scene of Christ entering contemporary Brussels in a Mardi Gras parade. In response to the French pointillist style, Ensor used palette knives, spatulas, and both ends of his brush to put down patches of colours with expressive freedom.
