The painting is titeld "Bohemian Landscape with Mount Milleschauer" by Caspar David Friedrich from 1808.
Friedrich can be regarded as the consummate master of early Romantic landscape painting. His work would have sufficed by itself to form our notion of Romantic painting. The symbolic language of his landscapes derives its vocabulary from the study of nature, and is based on a meditative internalisation of the experiences of the senses.
