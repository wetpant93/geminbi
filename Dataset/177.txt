The painting is titeld "Self-Portrait" by Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot from c. 1825.
This self-portrait may be the one Corot reportedly painted at his parents' request before leaving for a study trip to Italy in 1825. His views of Italy, in which he strove to capture the effects of light, represent a capital phase in his own painting and in the evolution of landscape painting as a whole.
