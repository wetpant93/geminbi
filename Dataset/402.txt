The painting is titeld "Family Gathering" by Jean-Frédéric Bazille from 1867.
This is perhaps the most famous painting by Bazille. It depicts a family in the shade on a terrace at Méric, near Montpellier in the south of France. The painting was accepted at the 1868 Salon. The picture, showing Bazille's parents and relations, conveys a sense of family and of social status, a particular lifestyle, and a fresh response to Nature and light; in painting it, Bazille was also out to convince his family of his ability as an artist.
