The painting is titeld "The Sick Child" by Eugène Carrière from 1885.
This large painting of a domestic genre scene is characteristic of Carrier's art. Bordering on both Realism and Impressionism, this friend of Gauguin usually painted his portraits and family groups in monochrome shades of gray and brown, and allowed the shapes to blend in a mysterious light.
