The painting is titeld "The Ham" by Paul Gauguin from c. 1889.
The subject of this still-life may have been influenced by a similar work by Manet, painted in the mid-1870s, which Gauguin would have seen at the home of his friend Degas, from 1888. (The work is now in the Burrell Collection, Glasgow.) Still-life painting had been practiced by Gauguin throughout his career, often when a model was unavailable. He owned a fine example by Cézanne, the Still-Life with Compotier, which he incorporated into the back of a work at this time, the so-called Portrait of a Woman with Still-Life by Cézanne.
