The painting is titeld "A Vase of Flowers on a Console" by Eug√®ne Delacroix from 1848-50.
Delacroix painted flower paintings and landscapes in his later years. The symbolic import typical of Delacroix's subjects seems here to be lacking. They might be described as an early case of 'art for art's sake'. Delacroix took time off from his exhausting monumental labours to paint the flowers in the garden of his friend George Sand.
