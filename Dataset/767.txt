The painting is titeld "Road in the Wood" by Narcisse Virgile Diaz De La Peña from 1850s.
Diaz de la Peña painted genre scenes in the spirit of the late Rococo, biblical compositions, and scenes from Eastern life, among other subjects. But his talent manifested itself most fully in the landscapes he created while associated with artists of the Barbizon school. Théodore Rousseau taught him to paint great sturdy trees, although Diaz's manner seems more reconciled and even charmingly naive.
