The painting is titeld "Triumph of a Roman Hero" by Vincenzo Camuccini from 1816.
This scene certainly represents a Roman Triumph, although the setting would not appear to be Rome itself. The painting probably depicts the triumph of Marcus Claudius Marcellus on the occasion of his victory over the Gauls.
