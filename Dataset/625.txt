The painting is titeld "Rocky Landscape near Ornans" by Gustave Courbet from 1855-60.
Courbet was drawn to the region around his hometown, Ornans, with its stream-filled valleys that are deeply carved into the landscape and bordered by the typical rock formations of the Jura. The overall sombre colouring, with the rich green contrasted with a vibrant pale blue, conveys the melancholy character of the rugged Jura landscape.
