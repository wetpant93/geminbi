The painting is titeld "Beach near Trouville" by Gustave Courbet from 1865.
This picture, painted by Courbet in the bathing resort of Trouville, provocatively has no identifiable subject and its effect lies entirely in the finely differentiated grey, ochre and blue colour tones which build up the image of beach, sea and sky in horizontal parallel bands.
