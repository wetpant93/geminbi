The painting is titeld "Caribbean Woman with Sunflowers" by Paul Gauguin from 1889.
In October 1889 Gauguin returned to Le Pouldu, where he stayed at the inn of Marie Henry with Meyer de Haan. Shortly after their arrival, they began to decorate the inn's dining room and this work was one of the panels Gauguin produced. It hung above the entrance doorway with a second version of Bonjour Monsieur Gauguin. The work's decorative purpose meant that Gauguin could capitalize on the heavily stylised forms, bold colours and abstract patterns which he had used in earlier works.
