The painting is titeld "The Pedicurist" by Edgar Degas from 1873.
The Pedicurist is another of Degas's tireless studies of everyday situations. Plainly the artist relishes showing the play of light on the bath towels and the pedicurist's bald patch; the translucence of the towel draped over the chair is particularly well achieved.
