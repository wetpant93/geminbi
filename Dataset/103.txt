The painting is titeld "Palais Brongniart, Place de la Bourse " by Giuseppe Canella from 1836.
Historically, stock trading took place at several spots in Paris, including Rue Quincampoix, Rue Vivienne (near the Palais Royal), and the back of the Opéra Garnier. In the early 19th century, the Parisian stock exchange found a stable location at the Palais Brongniart, or Palais de la Bourse. Designed by architect Alexandre-Théodore Brongniart (1739-1813) and completed in 1825, this imposing structure built in the classical Greek style, boasts 64 columns on the outside, in the manner of a Greek temple.
