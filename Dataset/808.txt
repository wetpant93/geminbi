The painting is titeld "The Guidini Family" by Giacomo Favretto from 1873.
The domestic setting, the fleeting glances, poses, and elegant dress are enlivened by effects of light and colour that the artist drew from his friend Ciardi. They combine to produce a serene, composed image of the family of engineer Guidini.
