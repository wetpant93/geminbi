The painting is titeld "The Dream" by Jean Baptiste Edouard Detaille from 1888.
In this painting the myth and reality confront each other. Soldiers have prepared themselves a place to rest for the night on the ground, their rifles have been placed upright to make a neat line that stretches as far as the horizon. An unworldly scene unfurls against the sky. French military triumph is represented by the patriotic colours of red, white, and blue.
