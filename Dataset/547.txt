The painting is titeld "Mont Sainte-Victoire and the Viaduct of the Arc River Valley" by Paul Cézanne from 1882-85.
Cézanne's main work was done in landscapes. He painted the river valleys of the Ile-de-France and, above all, his beloved hard, bright, sunbaked Provence. Over the course of decades he never tired of walking the hills in order to paint the majestic profile of Mont Sainte-Victoire, often with the valley of the Arc in the foreground and the impressive intrusion of a lengthy new railway viaduct.
