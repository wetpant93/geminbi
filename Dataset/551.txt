The painting is titeld "Pool at the Jas de Bouffan" by Paul Cézanne from 1882-85.
The Jas de Bouffan (House of the Wind), the former summer residence of the Governor of Provence, to the west of Aix, was bought by Cézanne's father in 1859. Its grounds, with their avenue of chestnut trees and stone pool, were the subject of many of Cézanne's paintings. The bright colours and parallel layers of brushstrokes reflect the influence of Pissarro.
