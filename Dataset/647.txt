The painting is titeld "The Studio of the Painter" by Gustave Courbet from 1855.
The subtitle of the huge painting is Real Allegory of Seven Years of My Artistic and Moral Life. Courbet did not like to talk about his art, but made an exception for this work: "It is the moral and physical story of my studio. ... it is the world that comes to be painted. ...The painting is divided into two parts. I am in the middle, painting. On the right are... friends... On the left, the other world of trivial life..."
