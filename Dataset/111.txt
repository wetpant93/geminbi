The painting is titeld "The Goethe Monument" by Carl Gustav Carus from 1832.
Carus was a great admirer of Goethe, who in turn highly appreciated both Carus's theoretical writings and his painting. Carus's painting of the Goethe monument is described in a contemporary journal as follows. "In a lonely rocky area stands Goethe's sarcophagus, and upon it a harp; moonlight falls through its strings, illuminating two angels who kneel reverently before it. Mists swirl around the base of the monument. It would seem that Goethe's manifold and magical contacts with Nature have inspired the ingenious artist to this Ossianic idea."
