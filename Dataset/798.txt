The painting is titeld "Corner of the Table" by Henri Fantin-Latour from 1873.
In this still-life the painter shows a bouquet of flowers without showing the vase or pot in which it stands. This was an allusive method that Japanese printmakers loved. The works of almost contemporary Japanese artists, such as Utagawa Kunisada and Katsushika Hokusai, were the first to reach the West and influenced painters in Paris.
