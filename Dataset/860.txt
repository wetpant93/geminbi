The painting is titeld "Landscape with Two Goats (Tarari maruru)" by Paul Gauguin from 1897.
Devoid of the idyllic tone that marks the majority of Gauguin's Tahitian works, this landscape with an undeciphered original title prompts thoughts of some mystic act performed at night. The shrill combinations of intense colours and the disturbing atmosphere of mystery anticipate the poetry and painting of the German Expressionists.
