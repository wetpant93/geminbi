The painting is titeld "Yosemite Valley at Sunset" by Albert Bierstadt from 1864.
Albert Bierstadt, a native of Germany, stood in the tradition of the Hudson River School, founded by the English-born Thomas Cole, which marked the beginning of a genuinely American landscape painting. He discovered the American wilderness for art, applying these means in the tradition of Claude Lorrain. In 1863, Bierstadt and the writer Fritz Hugh Ludlow set off on an expedition to the Wild West, which took them thousands of miles through the dramatic scenery of Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, California, and Oregon. The artist captured these impressions in a series of large-format panoramas that made him the founder of the Rocky Mountain School.
