The painting is titeld "The Virgin and Child" by William Dyce from 1845.
There exists an earlier painting (possibly dating from 1838) of the same subject in the Tate Gallery, London, and a variant of the present design in the Castle Museum, Nottingham. The latter, which is on slate, was made in preparation for the present picture. All three paintings have compositional affinities with Raphael, particularly works such as the Madonna del Granduca, the Madonna Tempi and the large Cowper Madonna. Dyce made a number of preparatory studies for the Virgin and Child and in a surprisingly wide variety of media - drawings, watercolours, oil and apparently even fresco, although this last item may be the painting on slate in Nottingham.
