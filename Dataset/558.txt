The painting is titeld "Self-Portrait in a Felt Hat" by Paul Cézanne from 1890-95.
In the 1890s, Cézanne continued to paint landscapes in and around Jas de Bouffan, as well as still-lifes and portraits. He often painted portraits of himself - his most patient model. For others, the endless sittings were often torture, because Cézanne demanded that his models remain absolutely motionless, posing almost as though they were objects in his still-lifes.
