The painting is titeld "Portrait of Victor Chocquet" by Paul Cézanne from 1879-82.
Victor Chocquet was a customs inspector, an enthusiastic art-lover and collector. Cézanne met him through Renoir, and a warm and close friendship grew up between the two. Chocquet had accumulated a significant collection of paintings and antiques in his apartment in the Rue de Rivoli, including twenty works by Delacroix alone, and works by Courbet, Manet and Corot. When the Impressionists held their second exhibition in 1876, he loaned paintings by Renoir, Pissarro and Monet.
