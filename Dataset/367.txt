The painting is titeld "Evening" by Caspar David Friedrich from c. 1824.
English influences, from Constable or others working in a similar vein, may account for Friedrich's interest in cloud studies, as evidenced by this painting, a small oil study on cardboard which is highly innovative, almost avant-garde in character.
