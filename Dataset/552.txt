The painting is titeld "Portrait of Achille Empéraire" by Paul Cézanne from 1867-70.
Achille Empéraire (1829-1898) was Cézanne's fellow-student at the Atelier Suisse, whom he greatly respected. Empéraire lived in extreme poverty; a hunch-backed dwarf, he never achieved recognition during his lifetime. Cézanne's portrait pays homage to his friend, showing him in a combination of dignified melancholy and pride.
