The painting is titeld "The Temptation of St Anthony" by Paul Cézanne from 1873-77.
The legend of St Anthony, the Egyptian hermit, was a particularly popular subject with artists in the second half of the nineteenth century. Cézanne has transposed the "temptation" to a romantic level and particularly emphasizes the sexual aspect of the story.
