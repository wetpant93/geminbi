The painting is titeld "Farmer in a field" by Vincent Van Gogh from September 1889, Saint-Rémy.
In the year before his death, Van Gogh lived in the asylum of Saint-Paul-de-Mausole. The present painting reflects an artist determined to heal himself through work. On most mornings between May 1889 and May 1890, the outside world visible to Vincent van Gogh appeared much like it does in this painting: a low stone wall enclosing a wheat field, a few poplars, an old farm house, a ploughman tilling the soil.
