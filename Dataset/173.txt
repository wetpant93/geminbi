The painting is titeld "Peasant Woman Pasturing a Cow by the Edge of a Forest" by Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot from 1865-70.
The austere yet in exhaustible range of silvery grey hues, together with the combination of a single mass of forest and lightly drawn tree, makes this painting characteristic of Corot's oeuvre. The figures in his late works appear to dissolve into nature. Here, the turn of the woman's body is presented so precisely that the entire landscape seems to be contained within her backward glance.
