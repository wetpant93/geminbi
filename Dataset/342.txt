The painting is titeld "The Russian Ship of the Line "Asow" and a Frigate at Anchor near Elsinore" by Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg from 1828.
After 1821 seascapes had become Eckersberg's favourite subject. They allowed him to bring together his interest in nature, ships, and meteorology, and over the next three decades he had the opportunity to depict almost every conceivable type of ship in every marine situation imaginable.
