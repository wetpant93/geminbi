The painting is titeld "Portrait of Baudelaire" by Gustave Courbet from c. 1848.
The Portrait of Baudelaire does not show the poet at his most brilliant. He is seen as scholar and critic: the author of the Salons. He is smoking a pipe and reading, while the pen lying on top of a book on his desk is too obvious an emblem of his profession.
