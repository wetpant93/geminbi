The painting is titeld "Louis d'Orléans Showing his Mistress" by Eugène Delacroix from 1825-26.
This painting illustrates an episode from Brantome's Vies des dames galantes; the Duke lifts a veil from his nude mistress for the edification of his chamberlain. However, he takes care to conceal her face, for she is, in fact, the chamberlain's wife. It seems probable that Delacroix, always short of money, chose this subject in hopes of a quick sale. The style and thematic presentation owe much to Delacroix's English friend Bonington, however, the rich colours and textures and the extraordinary virtuosity of the brushwork are pure Delacroix. A series of superlative nudes followed from this precedent.
