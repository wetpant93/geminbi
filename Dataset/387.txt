The painting is titeld "The Lifeboat is Taken through the Dunes" by Michael Peter Ancher from 1883.
With this painting Michael Ancher continued his tale of the heroic fishermen of Skagen. An epic on a grand scale, the narrative opened with the question Will He Weather the Point, went on to a happy preliminary end, as it were, with A Crew is Rescued and was finally concluded in The Drowned Fisherman.
