The painting is titeld "Friedrich Wilhelm III's Palm Court" by Karl Blechen from 1832.
Far away from the Frenchified classical grandeur of Frederick the Great, for whom the Sanssouci Palace was built in Potsdam, is the bourgeois apparatus of Frederick William III, seen in his "Gothic Moroccan" Palm Court on the on the Pfaueninsel (Peacock Island, an island situated in the Havel river near the Berlin Wannsee). Designed in an opulent late Regency style, this building is a reminder of the many marital and cultural links between Prussia and England.
