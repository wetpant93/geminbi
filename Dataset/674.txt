The painting is titeld "Mormons Visit a Country Carpenter" by Christen Dalsgaard from 1856.
Missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints first arrived in Denmark in June 1850. The painting, created only six years after their arrival, is set in the shadowed interior of a provincial cottage. A group of people are gathered around a table, listening to a missionary's message. Light filters in through a small window and an open door. It is a study of contemporary daily life, carefully depicting the interior and costumes of the people in detail.
