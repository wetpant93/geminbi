The painting is titeld "Miriam" by Anselm Friedrich Feuerbach from 1862.
Feuerbach's imposing Italian model, Anna Risi, the wife of a Roman shoemaker, is found in many of his paintings. Her severe beauty suggests both a dominatrix and a nanny. In Miriam, she poses as Moses' sister, striking a tambourine to celebrate the safe crossing of the Red Sea.
