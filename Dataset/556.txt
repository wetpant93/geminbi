The painting is titeld "Rocks in the Forest" by Paul Cézanne from c. 1893.
Cézanne exhibited with the Impressionists in 1874, and though he shared their plein air approach, he was preoccupied by other aims. While they sought to capture the fleeting impression of a casual glance, he often emphasized the forms and patterns that build the structure of a scene. He sought to reveal the inner geometry of nature.
