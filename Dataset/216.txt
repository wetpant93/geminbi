The painting is titeld "Load (Washerwoman)" by Honor√© Daumier from 1853.
Daumier often painted urban labourers under the Second Empire. There are several versions on the theme of the washerwoman. Two of them - one treauured in the National Gallery in Prague and one from the Collection of Gerstenberg/Scharf, Berlin, now in Hermitage, St. Petersburg are very similar.
