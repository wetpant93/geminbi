The painting is titeld "Eruption of the Volcano Vesuvius" by Johan Christian Clausen Dahl from 1821.
The Norwegian painter spent time in Italy in 1820-21, and while in Naples he witnessed the Vesuvius erupting, creating a range of drawings and painted studies of the event from the closest possible range. One of these studies served as the basis for this painting. He repeated the motif six times, a sure indication of its appeal for contemporary audiences.
