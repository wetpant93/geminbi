The painting is titeld "Volterra, the Citadel" by Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot from 1834.
From his second Italian journey in 1834 Corot brought back landscapes permeated by an astonishing luminosity, in particular those of Volterra and Venice. These faithful sketches taken from nature were subsequently reworked in the studio or kept as mementos for later compositions executed from memory.
