The painting is titeld "Self-Porrtrait" by Giovanni Fattori from 1854.
Looking with confidence at the viewer, Fattori, not yet thirty years old, is holding a painter's palette and a brush in his left hand as signs of his artistic vocation. Best known for his colourful landscape paintings, he also represented key events in recent Italian history of the Risorgimento, the Italian unification movement.
