The painting is titeld "Spring, Summer, Winter, Autumn" by Paul Cézanne from 1860-62.
In 1859 Cézanne's father bought the Jas de Bouffan (House of the Wind), the former summer residence of the Governor of Provence, to the west of Aix. Some of the rooms were in such poor condition that they were uninhabitable and remained locked up. The following year Cézanne, who was spending more and more of his time painting, was given permission by his father to paint a series of large murals in the salon.
