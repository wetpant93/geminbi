The painting is titeld "Haymaking" by Jules Bastien-Lepage from 1877.
Dubbed the "grandson of Millet and Courbet" by Zola, Jules Bastien-Lepage specialised in agricultural scenes which were a far remove from the affected pastoral scenes that cluttered the Salon. Zola was excited by Haymaking, seeing it as the masterpiece of naturalism in painting.
