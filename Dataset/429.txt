The painting is titeld "Campagna Landscape" by Arnold Böcklin from 1857-58.
Böcklin eschewed the barroom sensuality and "for real" finish of the Parisian's Salon art for a far more liberated and original experience. With radically differing styles at his command, the painter could render sensitive, almost Impressionistic views, such as this early landscape.
