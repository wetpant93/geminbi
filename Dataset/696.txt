The painting is titeld "Edmond Duranty" by Edgar Degas from 1879.
Louis Edmond Duranty (1833-1880) was a prolific French novelist and art critic. He supported the realist cause and later the Impressionists. He was a frequent visitor to the Caf√© Guerbois group, which included Manet, at the centre of the group, and many writers and painters. Their vigorous debates provided Degas with an entirely new mental environment.
