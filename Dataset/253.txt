The painting is titeld "Turkish Boys Let out of School" by Alexandre Gabriel Decamps from c. 1841.
During his travels in Greece and Turkey from 1827 to 1830, and in Italy in 1839, Decamps made a large number of studies and sketches that he would  later use throughout his career. He asserted himself as an orientalising painter at the Salon of 1831. The public enjoyed the anecdotal character of his oriental scenes, his pleasing themes of everyday life.
