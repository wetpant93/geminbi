The painting is titeld "Expulsion, Moon and Firelight" by Thomas Cole from c. 1828.
This enigmatic painting of visionary character is probably a version of another work by the artist, entitled The Expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden (now in Boston). It depicts the same landscape without the figures.
