The painting is titeld "Mountain Landscape with a Castle" by Johan Christian Clausen Dahl from 1816.
Although better know for his smaller scale works and plein-air sketches, Johan Christian Dahl's large, naturalistic landscapes were considered by his contemporaries to be his major artistic achievement. This work was painted in difficult conditions, at Engelholm, a windswept coastal town on the north west coast of the Scania peninsular, Sweden, a short boat trip from Elsinore.
