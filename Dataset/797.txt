The painting is titeld "Chrysanthemums in a Vase" by Henri Fantin-Latour from 1875.
Fantin-Latour's painting does not fall within a particular style. His portraits and still-lifes are decidedly Realist (he spent a period as a pupil of Courbet), whereas his mythological paintings are closer to academic painting, but with  hints of Symbolism.
