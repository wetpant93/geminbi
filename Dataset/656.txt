The painting is titeld "Young Man in a Landscape (The Guitarrero)" by Gustave Courbet from 1844.
Until the Revolution of 1848 only three of Courbet's pictures had to date been accepted by the Salon, the three self-portraits Self-Portrait with Black Dog, The Guitarrero, and Man with Leather Belt. These had the merit of making the artist as visible as the work.
