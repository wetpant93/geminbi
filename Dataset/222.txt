The painting is titeld "The Giralda, Seville" by Adrien Dauzats from 1836-37.
The Giralda once served as the minaret of the mosque of Seville, which was transformed into a cathedral in the thirteenth century. This informal sketch was painted during one of Dauzats's trips to Spain in the company of Baron Isidore Taylor (1789-1879), who played a crucial role in expanding French popular taste to include works of art from other cultures and scenes of travel abroad.
