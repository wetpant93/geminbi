The painting is titeld "Neptune's Horses" by Walter Crane from 1892.
In this composition, Walter Crane was inspired by the sight of the surf during a trip to America in 1892. The impression of the landscape is personified for him in the mythological figures of the sea god Neptune and his untamed horses, like in BÃ¶cklin's paintings. Crane created several colour schemes for his work in tempera and oil, the first of which he exhibited in the Water Colour Society in the winter of 1892-93.
