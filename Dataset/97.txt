The painting is titeld "Snow and Fog on the Grand Canal" by Ippolito Caffi from c. 1840.
As can be seen in this painting, Caffi owed much to eighteenth-century view painting in both the sharpness of his outlines and his perspective configurations. The unusual meteorological conditions that suspend Venice between sea and sky in an ash-gray mist enable the artist to unveil a range of colours his predecessors never imagined.
