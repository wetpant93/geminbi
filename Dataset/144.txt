The painting is titeld "Othello and Desdemona" by Alexandre-Marie Colin from 1829.
Colin may first have become interested in depicting Shakespearean subjects when he visited London in 1824 in the company of Delacroix and Bonington. The Othello and Desdemona is a bravura work, faithful to the text, and full of energy and colour.
