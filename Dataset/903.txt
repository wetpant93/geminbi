The painting is titeld "Vision after the Sermon (Jacob Wrestling with the Angel)" by Paul Gauguin from 1888.
Among Gauguin's masterpieces painted in Brittany are the Vision after the Sermon (1888) and the Yellow Christ (1889). In both paintings Breton peasants, to whom Gauguin was attracted as exotic, noncultivated types, figure prominently. Gauguin's usual bright colours and simplified shapes treated as flat silhouettes are present, but these paintings also reveal his symbolist leanings. Objects and events are taken out of their normal historical contexts.
