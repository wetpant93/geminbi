The painting is titeld "Veterans' Festival" by Henri Evenepoel from 1898.
In the late 1890s - his most productive period, brought to an abrupt end by the artist's early death - Evenepoel painted portraits, street scenes and interiors. The present painting shows his highly personal brand of Impressionism, and demonstrate his flair for unusual composition.
