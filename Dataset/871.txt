The painting is titeld "Self-Portrait" by Paul Gauguin from 1889.
In October 1889 Gauguin returned to Le Pouldu, where he stayed at the inn of Marie Henry with Meyer de Haan. Shortly after their arrival, they began to decorate the inn's dining room. The present work is part of the suite of decorative panels, along with the Caribbean Woman with Sunflowers. It formed the door of a cupboard with a portrait of Meyer de Haan opposite. These two works need to be read as a pair in order to appreciate the wealth of symbols they embody.
