The painting is titeld "Large Pine near Aix" by Paul Cézanne from 1895-97.
The pine that Cézanne painted several times seems here to be bestowing space with its branches. Space does not run away into the distance, as in classical perspective, but swells from the centre to the edges, becoming even more tangible as it approaches the foreground.
