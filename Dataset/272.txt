The painting is titeld "George Sand" by Eugène Delacroix from 1838.
George Sand (original name Aurore Dupin) was a free-spirited French Romantic writer. She scandalized 19th-century Paris when she defied convention and pioneered an independent path for women. She was noted for her numerous love affairs with such prominent figures as Prosper Merimée, Alfred de Musset, Frédéric Chopin, and others. Delacroix did not take her very seriously, but Chateaubriand was inspired of her work.
