The painting is titeld "Self-Portrait" by Alexandre Gabriel Decamps from 1830-32.
In Decamps work, the Oriental note - intended to stress the painter's bohemian status - is not limited to exotic attributes. The decorative eastern gown sets the tone for the whole colour scheme of the painting, filling it - beyond the obvious link with the elementary subject - with a heady sensuousness.
