The painting is titeld "Pigeon-post" by Miklós Barabás from 1843.
"What note is a gentleman supposed to write when he is sending a pair of pigeons to a young lady? ... 'Allow me to take the liberty of sending you, dear lady, a pair of doves as a present  ... When watching them play, think of your faithful admirer." This is what the Home Secretary of Pest-Buda in the year 1832 suggested to the gentlemen.
