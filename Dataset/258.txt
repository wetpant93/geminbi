The painting is titeld "A Mortally Wounded Brigand Quenches his Thirst" by Eug√®ne Delacroix from c. 1825.
Delacroix's experience of English artists is reflected here, alongside the influence of Venetian painting and the works of Rubens. A critic remarked: "The colour of this piece is as beautiful as some landscape imagined by Byron as the setting for the bloodstained body of one of the tyrants of Missolonghi."
