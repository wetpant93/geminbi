The painting is titeld "Winter Landscape" by Henri Van Assche from 1814.
The present winter landscape with resting lancers by a bridge depicts a group of Cossacks, with lances, at rest in a hard winter landscape. Van Assche occasionally collaborated with Eug√®ne Verboeckhoven (1799-1881), the figures and horses in the present painting were probably painted by Verboeckhoven.
