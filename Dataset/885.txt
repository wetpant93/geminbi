The painting is titeld "The Garden in Winter, Rue Carcel" by Paul Gauguin from 1883.
By 1883, and as a direct result of the collapse of the stock market the previous year, Gauguin's finances were in disarray, and he began to consider a change in career. This painting demonstrates an attempt to align himself with the landscape Impressionist painters, perhaps from a desire to make money from the sale of his works, and is in marked contrast to the more laboured works produced while he could still consider himself an amateur.
