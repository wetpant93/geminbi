The painting is titeld "Girl Wearing a Headscarf" by Jules Dalou from 1890-92.
The folds of the headscarf embracing the subject's unruly hair invest the sculpture with an ornamental circular motion characteristic of Art Nouveau. Dalou was active from the 1860s to the turn of the 20th century and paid tribute to all the successive trends of artistic fashion during that period.
