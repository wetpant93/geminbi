The painting is titeld "Bonaparte, Calm on a Fiery Steed, Crossing the Alps" by Jacques-Louis David from 1801.
Full of enthusiasm for the new ruler of France, David painted Bonaparte, Calm on a Fiery Steed, Crossing the Alps. The title shows what could be expected of the general: he would be capable of ruling supremely well over an unruly Europe.
