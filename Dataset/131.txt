The painting is titeld "Cross in the Wilderness" by Frederic Edwin Church from 1857.
This painting depicts a wild and desolate landscape developed around the central motif of the painting, the cross, which, though placed in a central position, is overshadowed and passes almost unnoticed among the grandeur of the natural setting.
