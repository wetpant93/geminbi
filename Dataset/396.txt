The painting is titeld "Woman Sewing on the Terrace" by Cristiano Banti from 1882.
In this scene of tranquil domesticity, the artist has chosen an unusual vantage point from a position far below the subject. This approach may have been influenced by the compositions of Japanese prints, which were so popular this time.
