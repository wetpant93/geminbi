The painting is titeld "The Race Track. Amateur Jockeys by a Carriage" by Edgar Degas from 1876-87.
Horse racing, a sport of English origin, became popular on the Continent at the end of the eighteenth century, and soon inspired such painters as Carle Vernet and Théodore Géricault, who were both influenced by English artists. It attracted the interest of later painters, too. Manet emphasized the elegance of these occasions, while Degas preferred to observe the horses in motion. He focused on the movements of man and animal. His first sketches of racecourses date back to the beginning of the 1860s. At first he was interested  in the jockeys, but he also turned a keen eye on the spectators.
