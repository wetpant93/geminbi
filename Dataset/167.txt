The painting is titeld "Corot's Studio" by Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot from c. 1873.
Toward the end of his life Corot revived the theme of the painter's studio: a model posing, or a gathering of connoisseurs or artists. In a few instances he depicted a young girl seated in front of one of his own pictures, contemplative, or lost in reverie.
