The painting is titeld "The Campagna at Lungezza near Rome" by Jean-Achille Benouville from 1848.
The painting is dominated by the ruins of an ancient building and beyond, barely visible, we can glimpse what may be a country villa or a small hamlet. On a small rise in the foreground a lone shepherd stands looking back at his flock.
