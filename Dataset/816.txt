The painting is titeld "Sermon on the Mountain" by Károly Ferenczy from 1896.
The  first summer in Nagybánya resulted a large size composition of a biblical nature. The gloomy and splendid landscape inspired the painter to pass on a serious message. The three major elements of the composition  are a group of people in the foreground, light green leaves of the trees in the forest and monumental mountain chain the background. Critics concluded from the dominance of nature that in the case of this picture nature dominates man who is subordinated to it, although Ferenczy does not consider him insignificant. He emphasizes the group of people by applying various tools: they are placed in the foreground, formal connections are justified by content  and are the lightest strip as far as colour is concerned. Ferenczy was reported to have been preparing for this biblical topic very seriously. His family, friends and models accompanied him to the mountain he had selected and they  posed for his picture. The final version was predecessed by a lot of studies and sketches, as well as an oil sketch for the whole composition which was ready by 1896.
