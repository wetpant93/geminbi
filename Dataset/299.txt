The painting is titeld "The Fanatics of Tangier" by Eug√®ne Delacroix from 1837-38.
Delacroix witnessed this event through the shutters of an upper-storey window, in either Tangier or Meknes. The subject is difficult to understand, and Delacroix offered an explanation in the brochure for the 1838 Salon: "These fanatics are called Issaouis, after their founder Ben Issa. At certain times of year, they meet outside towns; then, their enthusiasm excited by prayers and wild cries, they enter into a veritable state of intoxication, and, spreading through the streets, perform a thousand contortions, and even dangerous acts."
