The painting is titeld "Promenade in the Parc des Lions at Port-Marly" by Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot from 1872.
Corot was one of the principal representatives of French Realist landscape painting, and a precursor of Impressionism. He was already 76 when he completed this painting, which synthesizes the most important features of his art. His work was outstanding in its time, and in its desire to depict nature truthfully was an important forerunner of what was to come.
