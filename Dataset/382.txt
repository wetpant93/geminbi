The painting is titeld "Fireworks in Naples" by Oswald Achenbach from 1875.
Achenbach's favourite theme was the striking states of nature: a moonlit night, thunderclouds, fog, and so on. In the present work, his effective approach doubles the real-life event in pursuit of the same goal: a powerful visual impression.
