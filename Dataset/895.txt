The painting is titeld "The White Horse" by Paul Gauguin from 1898.
This canvas, typical of Gauguin's late style, is one of the most successful paintings done on Tahiti. The animal stands at the front in water amidst mysterious vegetation. In the centre and background are two almost hidden horsemen emerging from the branches of the trees.
