The painting is titeld "Easter Morning" by Caspar David Friedrich from c. 1833.
Friedrich's subject matter is drawn from nature but is not an objective vision of it. Rather, it is a mystic one, imbued with a symbolic character. His pictures often show figures seen from behind and contemplating the landscape.
