The painting is titeld "The Barque of Dante" by Eugène Delacroix from 1822.
The first of Delacroix's paintings to achieve true notoriety, Dante and Virgil in Hell or The Barque of Dante, exemplifies a duality that pervaded his entire career. The shared influence of Michelangelo and Rubens is manifest here, but there is also a savour of the revolution so thunderously proclaimed by his friend and elder, Theodore Géricault, in his immortal painting, The Raft of the Medusa (1819).
