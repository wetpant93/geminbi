The painting is titeld "View of the Room of the Ark" by Luigi Ademollo from 1816.
Luigi Ademollo, an Italian painter, draftsman, and engraver, was the uncle of the painter Carlo Ademollo (1825-1911). The Tuscan activities of this Lombard painter contributed to the establishing of modern Nea-Classical aesthetics in Florence. His decorative scenographic paintings on subjects drawn from mythology and Greek and Roman history, rich in grandiloquent archeologisms. certainly produced responses from local artists. Two representative examples of Ademollo's style and language are the painting decoration of the Palatine Chapel (1791-92) and of the later (1816) Sala dell'Arca (Room of the Ark) in the Pitti palace.
