The painting is titeld "Floor Scrapers" by Gustave Caillebotte from 1875.
Caillebotte was especially interested in light in the open, and fleeting impressions of a kind hitherto not considered proper subjects, while he was drawn thematically to human figures and aspects of urban life. His view of Impressionist realism was closest to that of Degas, however, he was also more open than the others to the world of hard physical work, and more emphatic in his willingness to take it as his subject.
