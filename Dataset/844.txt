The painting is titeld "Christ in the Garden of Olives" by Paul Gauguin from 1889.
Gauguin has returned to a scene from Christ's Passion, chronologically preceding that of the Green Christ and the Yellow Christ, in which his isolation and impending martyrdom are made apparent by the gloomy tonality against which his flaming hair glows, and by an all-encompassing landscape which heightens the sense of alienation. Once again, the identification of the artist with Christ is too overt to be overlooked.
