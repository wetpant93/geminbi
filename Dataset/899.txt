The painting is titeld "Two Girls Bathing" by Paul Gauguin from 1887.
Gauguin had already turned to the theme of bathing in works like The Beach at Dieppe, but this was his first attempt at the subject of two female bathers which he was to develop in Tahiti. The work went on display at the Parisian gallery of Boussod and Valadon in February 1888.
