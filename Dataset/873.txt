The painting is titeld "Still-Life with Mandoline" by Paul Gauguin from 1885.
The significance of this still-life seems to have been highly personal and it was probably painted either while Gauguin was still in Copenhagen with his wife's family or just after he arrived back in Paris with Clovis. The canvas in the background can be identified as one from his collection by the artist Armand Guillaumin, with whom Gauguin had painted in the summer of 1881. The mandoline was one of the possessions that he took on all his travels and the vase is very similar to those that Gauguin started to make the following year.
