The painting is titeld "View of Salzburg with the Kapuzinerberg" by Johann Fischbach from 1844.
Fischbach, the successful landscape and watercolour painter, who settled in Salzburg between 1840 an 1860, chose for this painting the motif of the view of the right bank of the Salzach river with the Kapuzinerberg and the Capuchin monastery. The depiction of the town is characterised by attention to detail and, compared with the landscape, the town seems to be painted in miniature. A watercolour study for this work dating from 1842/43 is to be found in the Graphische Sammlung of the Residenzgalerie in Salzburg.
