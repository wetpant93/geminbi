The painting is titeld "Rehearsal of the Ballet Onstage" by Edgar Degas from 1874.
There are three similar versions of this scene. The largest, painted in grisaille (Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris), appeared in the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874. The two others, tentatively dated the same year, are in the Metropolitan's collection. Both works were executed over an ink drawing on paper, an unusual practice for Degas.
