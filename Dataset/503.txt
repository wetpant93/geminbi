The painting is titeld "Sailing Boats at Argenteuil" by Gustave Caillebotte from c. 1888.
This work reveals the extent to which Caillebotte's art was characterized by his admiration for impressionistic painting. It shows the riverbank and the landing stage near his house in Le petit Gennevilliers, on the opposite side of the river from Argenteuil. The old wooden bridge at Argenteuil and the pillars of the railroad bridge can be seen in the background.
