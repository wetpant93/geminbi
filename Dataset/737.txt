The painting is titeld "The Star - Dancer on the Stage" by Edgar Degas from 1878.
The painting shows the star of the show dancing a solo turn on an empty stage. Other dancers can partly be seen waiting in the wings. The ballerina is on her toes, completing an arabesque which Degas renders very precisely through the positions of arms and the one visible leg and the slight inclination of the head too.
