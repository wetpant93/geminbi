The painting is titeld "Girl at the Piano (The Tannhäuser Overture)" by Paul Cézanne from c. 1869.
Colour was a passion of Paul Cézanne. He said that it was important for him to make fully fledged colours out of black and white, which, in the previous tradition, had been neutral and lacking in depth. In this early work, painted under the impression of Richard Wagner's music, the formulation of that task is already evident.
