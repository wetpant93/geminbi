The painting is titeld "Couple in the Street" by Charles Angrand from 1887.
Angrand was one of Seurat's first followers. He moved on from vigorous and spontaneous brushwork to a dense fabric of points. His working-class couple out walking have their own simple dignity, and are well established in the light ochres of the clearly structured street scene.
