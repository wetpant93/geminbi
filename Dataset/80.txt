The painting is titeld "Ceres and Triptolemos" by KÃ¡roly Brocky from c. 1853.
In Greek mythology, Triptolemus was the son of Celeus, king of Attica. He was born at Eleusis in Attica, and was cured in his youth of a severe illness by the care of Ceres, who had been invited into the house of Celeus, as she traveled over the country in quest of her daughter. Ceres instructed Triptolemus how to sow corn and make bread.
