The painting is titeld "Landscape with Oaks" by Alexandre Calame from 1859.
Nineteenth-century Europeans were enthusiastic travelers who discovered for themselves the history and culture of the world. Yet they also devoted much attention to the countryside of their native lands. Freed from allegory and the goal of producing an integral image of the cosmos, the landscape took on a regional-studies function. Swiss artist Alexandre Calame, whose oeuvre is bound up with the Alps, is one representative of this tendency.
