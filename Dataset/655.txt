The painting is titeld "Young Ladies by the River Seine" by Gustave Courbet from 1856-57.
A scene of leisure and relaxation on the banks of the Seine, the picture shows two young Second Empire ladies, weary, inactive, provocative â€” and liable to all kinds of sexual interpretation. Courbet paid particular attention to the details of their clothes.
