The painting is titeld "The Anger of Achilles, or Sacrifice of Iphig√©nie" by Jacques-Louis David from 1825.
In his later career, David developed a more intense and contrasting palette and a newfound desire for greater realism in his portrayal of figures in his classical history and mythological subjects.
