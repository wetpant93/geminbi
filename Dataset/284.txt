The painting is titeld "Medea about to Kill her Children" by Eug√®ne Delacroix from 1838 (1862).
As to the Medea in this painting, no heroine could better express the destructive power of women, a theme dear to the Romantics as it was to their successors, the Symbolists. Repudiated by Jason, Medea takes her revenge by killing the two children she has born to him; the subject is taken from Euripides' tragedy, Medea.
