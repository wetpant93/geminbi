The painting is titeld "The Green Christ or The Calvary" by Paul Gauguin from 1889.
In October 1889, Gauguin settled in Marie Henry's inn at Le Pouldu, an isolated village in Brittany. One after the other, he produced such works as The Yellow Christ, The Green Christ or The Calvary, La Belle Ang√®le. These works showed that he was in full possession of his art, with an equally masterful control of vision, plastic form, and technique.
