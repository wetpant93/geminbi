The painting is titeld "Beach at Trouville" by Eug√®ne Boudin from 1893.
In the 1890s Boudin, who had once been a mentor to Claude Monet. came in turn under the influence of Monet and often worked en plein air on the Normandy coast. But, true to tradition, he subordinated colour to the molding of form, thus giving his barely delineated groups on the seashore the persuasiveness of scenes from life.
