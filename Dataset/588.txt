The painting is titeld "A Schevening Pinck Preparing for Sea" by Edward William Cooke from 1877.
Cooke was almost obsessively interested in recording his natural and man-made environment. The marine artist Clarkson Stanfield employed him to make drawings of nautical details, while a friendship with the captain of the West Indiaman Thetis gave Cooke opportunities for study on board.
