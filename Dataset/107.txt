The painting is titeld "A Gondola on the Elbe near Dresden" by Carl Gustav Carus from 1827.
In this painting Carus also shows the figures from behind, so that the viewer experiences the boat trip. At the same time the boat is framed like a vista from the window, creating a picture within a picture.. This was an effect that Friedrich used in many of his interiors where he shows a view out of a window.
