The painting is titeld "Work" by Ford Madox Brown from 1852-63.
Ford Madox Brown had a wide knowledge of continental history painting, but had been particularly impressed by the medievalism of the Nazarenes. His early pictures show him trying to combine such medievalism with the naturalist tradition, giving his work a vigour that was readily appreciated by the younger Pre-Raphaelites.
