The painting is titeld "Peasants under the Trees at Dawn" by Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot from 1840-45.
Corot's 'studies' painted outdoors directly from the motif were private works and were not exhibited by him at the Paris Salons. They were none the less formative on generations of artists, having been bought up after Corot's death by fellow-painters, including Degas. A late developer, inspired by Constable's landscapes exhibited at the Salon of 1824, fortunate to be supported and encouraged by his parents, Corot became one of the most unassuming revolutionaries in the history of art. He is the agent of change from the severely stylised French 'ideal landscape' tradition derived from Poussin and Claude to modern landscape painting, finding classical peace and harmony in the face of nature itself.
