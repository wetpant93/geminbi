The painting is titeld "The Black Clock" by Paul CÃ©zanne from 1869-71.
Every object in this painting, with its rhythmic horizontal and vertical construction, forms an integral part of the rigorous structure and yet also exists in its own right. There is a stark contrast between the organic opening of the seashell and the cold marble of the clock.
