The painting is titeld "Portrait of Jean-Baptiste Faure" by Marcellin Desboutin from 1874.
The works of Desboutin, an acquaintance of Degas, who never experienced difficulty exhibiting the Salon, cannot be described as Impressionist. His small portrait of the baritone Jean-Baptiste Faure - who was a collector of Manet, Degas, Monet and Sisley - could just as easily have been hung in the Salon, even if it has the flavour of a study. Desboutin's picture portrays Faure in an appropriately affected pose in character for a Meyerbeer opera.
